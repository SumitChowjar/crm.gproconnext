Without love, our most extraordinary gifts and highest achievements are ultimately fruitless to the church and before God.

In this age of increased mobility and multiplicity of options, the single female has become a familiar element in the composition of teams working in cross-cultural settings. Further, there are rising numbers of mission workers who are Asian and under thirty. I was one of them. At a young age, I was exposed to the world of mission and missionaries through my parents. After university, professional exams, and a few years spent in a budding career, I began to actively pursue the Lord’s will for my life in cross-cultural mission. This led to a discovery of the heart to be part of building His Kingdom, particularly amongst a people loved—Muslims whom we long to call brothers and sisters in Christ…

Mission leaders used to write to mobilisers telling them to stop recruiting single ladies as if it were their fault that the men were not being reached, as if we should stop reaching Asian women for Christ to solve this serious problem. Gender imbalance in its extreme form in East Asian churches causes suffering for Christian women. How is support being provided? It also challenges the way both missionaries and local believers have sought to reach men, the theological and missiological principles that define the way we work.

“Best Practice” is a new name for an old practice. When we taste a great cookie at the church potluck and ask the cook for her recipe, that is recognizing a best practice. When we hear a great sermon and order a tape or CD, that is wanting a copy of a best practice. When Christianity Today gives awards to the best 10 books of 2005, that is another way of recognizing best practices…

Is it possible, is it legitimate, and is it helpful for Christians to read the whole Bible from the angle of mission? Chris Wright argues that it is, if we understand mission not in the “narrowly defined sense of human missionary activity” but in terms of “the plan, purpose and mission of God for the whole of creation.” (532) Wright contends that the whole Bible is about mission, God’s mission to the world. He concedes that are many different ways in which we can understand and interpret the Bible but traces one central theme running from Genesis to Revelation: God’s desire to bless all the nations…

We all know that we live in the midst of a rapidly changing world.

In the last two decades, tentmaking missions became a very critical issue in missions in many countries in Asia, in South America and in Africa as well as in America and England…

The Neo-Evangelicals were marked by anti-intellectualism and by a limited view of [w]holistic ministry, or engagement in social action. Wager concludes his paper with a call: ""What I sense we need is faithfulness to those few core values that make evangelicals what they are. Living true to the teaching of Scripture, being obedient to Jesus Christ, a brave engagement with the world as it is, and a continuing to pray for the genuine conversion of people.""

Sometimes there are questions that need to be answered before reading begins. If you are using the study guide in a small group setting, you could set a goal of reading and processing one chapter each week. Please take time to pray and report on the action steps from the previous week’s “to do” assignment before discussing new material. The Greek mind was interested in knowing the truth. Ancient Greeks wanted to fill the mind with knowledge, but had little interest in application of what they were learning. In contrast, the Hebrew mind was interested in both knowing the truth and in doing the truth. Today many Christians are more like Greeks than Hebrews. This study guide will encourage you to be a Hebrew. Therefore, in this study guide there are two parts to each chapter. In the section marked know you will be challenged with questions that will help you reflect on what you are reading. The section marked do will challenge you to put into practice at least one thing that you have learned during that week’s study. May God richly bless you as you process the material in LifeWork.

He tells his story of the difficulties his parents faced ministering in a city of poverty, with the closing of the docklands, high crime rates and gang warfare, and the promise God gave to them over 20 years ago when they felt called to kneel on the banks of the Manchester Ship Canal amidst the derelict docklands and pray that God would bring restoration to their city. God spoke to them clearly that day and gave them the promise that the world would come to Salford one day. This seemed an impossible word, but God spoke to them on the very spot where Media City Uk stands today, opened in 2012 as a new centre for the BBC and Granada TV, broadcasting across the world and bringing world leaders to be interviewed there.

God is changing this revered institution and is making a new collective awareness of an age-old revelation, a corporate spiritual echo that reflects God's desire for the church. In this book, Simson brings to light what God is saying to Christians everywhere. Researched across the globe, he presents the case for the reformation of the church's existence. In a world where the church is being ignored, it is time to bring the church to the people and not the people to the church. Whether it is what we know as church from the last five years or the last five hundred years, no one has truly been able to break free from the structures of the past.

In the nineteenth century white missionaries went to parts of Africa knowing that their life expectancy was only a few months. They came and they died and many Africans put their trust in Jesus Christ. And again God was black. In a rough-hewn, crowded shack in America, a black slave, having nothing in this life but hopelessness and chronic, bone-weary fatigue, found his release in Jesus Christ. From being a miserable slave he became the child of a King. As the Scripture had promised, the lowly slave was filled with the Spirit of God. God took up His residence in the black slave. The black body became the temple for the Holy Spirit of God. God's exterior was black. So God was not only white. Or brown or yellow or red. God was black as well. In the segregated streets of the South, in the ghettos of Watts and Hough and Newark and Detroit, and in a few - a very, very few - wealthy and influential homes, wherever Jesus has found a home in the heart of our Negro citizens, God is black. What's it like when God is black? Are the prejudices swept away, the doors flung open, the awesome power of God just as effective? I think I can tell you. Because I am black and God lives within me, too. I'd like to tell you my story of what it's like when God is black.

is time enough for the excitement of past events to fade away.

the account of the author's original research and analysis of the Foursquare
Church's burgeoning mission outreach in the Philippines.
This part of the Church relied neither on foreign missionary personnel
nor on foreign funds for its success; it relied conspicuously on the Holy
Spirit. Therefore the lessons which Pentecostals and non-Pentecostals alike
can learn from the Foursquare Church are still viable.
This is why the present edition of this book should be no less exciting

Nothing exemplifies their faith and courage more than the bold step they took in mid-career to leave a comfortable position in an established mission agency to pioneer Dawn Ministries, fully expecting to lose their home, their car, their regular income and who knows what else. And nothing could highlight God's faithfulness more than his constant, loving provision of their needs ever since.

"Missions: 13 Steps to a Successful Growth Program","5d9e1387-f202-104c-62f0-595c447849a0","At the heart of the DAWN strategy for saturating countries with evangelical congregations until there is one for every small group of people in every ethnic and cultural setting is the Church denomination. It is the denominational growth programs in the Philippines, for example, that have brought about the doubling of the rate of growth for that whole nation in the past ten years and has kept them on target for the goal of 50,000 churches by 200 AD. A study of those denominational programs--and those in other nations as well--reveals at least 13 common denominators that seems to be essential ingredients for any successful growth program.

Curiously, it is based on a number of wonderful facts. The gospel has now gone to the ends of the earth. Christians have now fulfilled the Great Commission in at least a geographical sense. At this moment of history, we can acknowledge with great respect and pride those evangelists of every nation who have gone before us and whose sacrificial efforts and heroic accomplishments have made Christianity by far the world’s largest and most widespread religion, with a Christian church on every continent and in practically every country. This is no hollow victory. Now more than at any time since Jesus walked the shores of Galilee, we know with complete confidence that the gospel is for all men, that it makes sense in any language and that it is not merely a religion of the Mediterranean or of the West.

That kind of sight is something our optic nerves do not handle. “The eyes of the heart” (Eph 1:18) are quite apparently not the eyes of our heads.

Recently, evangelicals, too, have thought a lot about trends in history and their relationship to events to come. The massive response a while back to Hal Lindsey’s books and films about possible events in the future has shown us that people are responsive to a “where are we going?” approach to life.

The numerous personal stories and that of Jim’s friends and colleagues are a reflection of this. The unique contribution of this book is that it is written by an Asian, from an Asian perspective, with Asian experience, narrating stories and addressing issues of missions in the Asian world. Jim spells out the issues and dilemmas on the mission field and brings a biblical perspective to it. With real life case studies and practical suggestions, Jim brings us into the living room of the mission field. He takes away the mystery of going to the mission field and plants our feet firmly on the ground. Although Jim has written the book for missions and church leaders and prospective missionaries it is also relevant to all of us. Today, in many of the countries we live in, cross-cultural missions is at our doorstep.

Proclaiming the word of God and witnessing to the world is essential for every Christian. At the same time, it is necessary to do so according to gospel principles, with full respect and love for all human beings. Aware of the tensions between people and communities of different religious convictions and the varied interpretations of Christian witness, the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue (PCID), the World Council of Churches (WCC) and, at the invitation of the WCC, the World Evangelical Alliance (WEA), met during a period of 5 years to reflect and produce this document to serve as a set of recommendations for conduct on Christian witness around the world. This document does not intend to be a theological statement on mission but to address practical issues associated with Christian witness in a multi-religious world. The purpose of this document is to encourage churches, church councils and mission agencies to reflect on their current practices and to use the recommendations in this document to prepare, where appropriate, their own guidelines for their witness and mission among those of different religions and among those who do not profess any particular religion. It is hoped that Christians across the world will study this document in the light of their own practices in witnessing to their faith in Christ, both by word and deed.

Traditionally, missionaries with guilt-oriented met shame-oriented indigenous people. The conscience orientation influences personality and culture, and consequently also theology and missions. It influences all spheres of private and public life. Shame and guilt-oriented people have different concepts of sin, salvation and forgiveness. They have different needs in relation to community life. They communicate differently. Newly, these differences occur not only between missionaries and indigenous people, but also between the older and younger generation in Europe and North America.

Western missions have tended to place most of their training emphasis on schooling and formal education-- witness the number of Bible schools, Christian colleges and theological seminaries that offer everything from a B.A. to a Ph. D. in missions/missiology. But the training concerns expressed by non-Western leaders from Asia, Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, the South Pacific, and the Middle East offer an alternative. While not dismissing the contribution of formal education, most of the newer training programmes are committed to a greater balance between formal, non-formal and informal education. Can the West learn from these insights? We have traditionally tended to think the opposite. But in the case of the training of missionaries, perhaps it is time for a critical re-examination of what we are attempting to do and why we do it.

Can the West learn from these insights? We have traditionally tended to think the opposite. But in the case of the training of missionaries, perhaps it is time for a critical re-examination of what we are attempting to do and why we do it.

"Missions: The Role of the Gentiles in Jewish Evangelism","6fb2be6b-ee7f-2287-67bb-595dee67dadb","We are not here concerned with the general duty that all Christians have toward their unconverted and redeemed fellow-humans, the Jewish people included. As we intimated earlier, the duty of gentile Christians toward their fellow humans who are Jewish is equal to that which they have toward those who are not Jewish. Our task is to discover whether or not Christians from among the gentiles have a specific evangelistic role with regard to the Jewish people. My purpose in this article will not be to work out the details of that role but to try and indicate its very existence. It appears to me from the biblical data that gentiles do indeed have a role in Jewish evangelism and that this aspect of the ministry of the church must be undertaken by the disciples of Jesus with dedication, commitment, sacrifice and a humility born of the Gospel.

"Missions: Reformed Perspectives in Jewish Evangelism","7c2ee82a-fddf-a595-786f-595df0bd5d45","We would do best to begin with a definition of the terms used in our review of Reformed Perspectives in Jewish Evangelism. By “Reformed” we refer to that depository of warmhearted Christian conviction found in the historic creeds, particularly the Westminster, Helvietic and London or Philadelphia Confessions of Faith. To the consensus of these I ascribe and have every reason to believe that participating members of the PCA 2008 General Assembly do as well. Those are our common grounds and the basis on which our present review is conducted. Pertinent to the present discussion, the items of faith we most value are our view of God as the eternally (Deut. 32:40, Jer. 10:10) glorious (Psa. 93:2),holy (I Sam. 2:2, Isa. 6:1–5), happy (I Tim. 1:11), good (Ex. 34:6, Psa. 17:7) and self sufficient one (Isa. 40:28, Eccl. 3:14) who exists in and of himself (Isa. 44:6, John 5:26) and for whom all else exists (I Cor. 8:6, Heb.2:10) ; the one God who is three (Isa. 48:16; John 14:6) equally glorious and divine (II Cor. 13:14) persons, worthy (Rom. 9:5) of and righteously demanding (I Chron. 29:11, Psa. 46:10), the praise and obedient worship of his rational creatures. God’s self sufficiency is expressed
in his absolute sovereignty over all; in a grace that is given solely at his good
pleasure and apart from any creaturely desert; in the unique and final authority of scripture in all matters of faith and practice; in the wonderful work of the Holy Spirit regenerating those appointed by God for salvation and resulting in faith, repentance and a new life; in the assurance of adoption and justification; in the law and its ongoing
role in the spiritual life; in the necessity and usefulness of church life and the hope of eternal life.General Eschatology is not an issue for our purposes: regardless of whether we embrace any of the common eschatological schemes, Jews need to hear the Gospel and Reformed Perspectives must guide our every evangelistic effort.

"Missions: Learning to be a Missionary","1e1c6c3f-d5b7-3909-3a58-595df1c73dbb","The authors apply the skill acquisition model developed by education philosopher Hubert Dreyfus to the development of effective cross-cultural ministry practitioners -- missionaries. This model sets forth five stages in the process by which people acquire skill in particular activities or professions. The authors suggest that the problem of missionary attrition may have direct correspondence to a lack of critical skill acquisition.

The book applies equally to all kinds of training centers, programs and institutions, whether they focus on non-formal or totally formal education. All the writers of this book, and I join them (educators, program developers and reflective practitioners), agree on the imperative core issues that must characterize the best of integral ministry training— whether within culture or cross-culture, whether close or far, whether with mother tongue or as a result of learning a new language. The book builds on our previous publications, but it clearly moves the agenda forward with boldness, challenging again some of the treasured assumptions we have defended regarding training/equipping of called and gifted servants for ministry.

While the focus is on missionary training in non-Western countries, the underlying concepts and their application directly relate to every form of ministry training, including pastoral training and curriculum enhancement at existing schools. Guidance is provided for profiling the understandings, skills, and character qualities needed by trainees and for providing training appropriate to the trainees' culture and sensitive to cultures in which they will serve. Examples of both missionary training profiles and missionary trainer profiles are included.

With their specialised ministries they grasp the opportunities of the day with unseen flexibility and creativity. A second aspect of modern mission is the growing trend towards co-operation and merger of organisations, the development of strategic alliances and partnerships for increased efficiency and good stewardship in order to make best use of our (limited) resources. How do these two contrasting trends affect global mission, the care for missionaries and missionary attrition, the premature return of workers from the field?

"Medical Killing - An Evangelical Perspective","b5e9fd32-a03f-bb0c-f950-595f336ef26b","Evangelicals are unconditionally opposed to active euthanasia. Indirect euthanasia is seen as simply belonging to the risks inherent in any medical intervention. Passive euthanasia is accepted if used if used in order to save the dignity of the saving and is seen as merely ceasing to interfere with an irreversible dying process. The basis of evangelical ethics is the Bible supplemented by science and experience as a kind of natural law. Even though natural law comes under Biblical revelation, its acceptance is the reason for the similarity of the Evangelical and the Roman-Catholicism position of Evangelicals. Evangelicals stress the necessity of a better counseling and investment for the deadly ill patient.

Many Christians object, at least in theory, to going to court or to using the methods of a constitutional state.

"Martin Luther – The Problem of Faith and Reason","9185bc7b-db66-8d87-e856-595f378713f9","Luther’s critics have consistently charged him as an irrationalist and pessimist concerning reason’s capabilities, and even by his followers as a fideist who sees little or no relationship between faith and reason. In this book, David Andersen offers a fresh and timely re-evaluation of Luther and his understanding of the relationship between faith and reason based upon a thorough engagement with Luther’s mature writings. Dr. Andersen persuasively argues that, far from being either an irrationalist or a fideist, Luther stands within an empiricist tradition and that his pronouncements on fallen human reason can be understood only from that philosophical perspective. Based upon recent research into the writings of William of Ockham, who positively influenced Luther in this area, Dr. Andersen also shows that Luther can no longer be charged as a pessimist concerning human knowledge. Reason has an important role to play for Luther in bringing one to faith, and the objectivity of Christ’s resurrection serves as that focal point that validates all Christian discourse. In subordinating itself to the facts of the death and resurrection of Christ for the forgiveness of sins, reason’s created function is restored to some extent as it receives that forgiveness in the words of Holy Scripture and the visible means of Baptism and the Lord’s Supper.

"What Difference Does the Trinity Make?","ea12b32f-4abc-6b84-0148-595f38b33c52","As a young man, Tom Johnson found himself to be a member of a small church that was rapidly becoming an authoritarian, legalistic, irrational cult. After observing the destructive results of this pseudo-church in the lives of its members, Johnson and some other students began a biblical critique of the movement which led to its disintegration and collapse. Some former members rejected the Christian faith because of what they had experienced. Johnson began an anxious quest for an alternate model or paradigm on what the Christian faith and life are, because he felt that continuing to be a practicing Christian might be possible with a better overall perspective on what Christians should believe and how they should live. This book contains some of the fruit of his anxious quest, a renewed Trinitarian faith and worldview.

"Paul in Conflict with the Veil","5d5a548e-f36f-fc03-d7d0-595f3bc39cb4","Exegetical examination of 1 Corinthians 11,2-16, following an alternative view of John Lightfoot, member of the Westminster assembly in the 16th century. Schirrmacher argues that from the biblical teaching that man is the head of woman (1 Cor 11:3) the Corinthians had drawn the false conclusions that in prayer a woman must be veiled (11:4-6) and a man is forbidden to be veiled (11:7), and that the wife exists for the husband but not the husband for the wife (11:8-9). Paul, however, rejected these conclusions and showed in 11:10-16 why the veiling of women did not belong to God’s commandments binding upon all the Christian communities. After stating the thesis and presenting his alternative translation and exposition of 1 Cor 11:2-16, he considers the difficulties in the text, presents his alternative exposition in detail (in the form of thirteen theses), discusses quotations and irony in 1 Corinthians, and deals with other New Testament texts about women’s clothing and prayer and about the subordination of wives.

"Natural Law Ethics","abf53059-d144-5309-a646-595f3b651e32","Throughout the twentieth century evangelical theology and philosophy neglected or rejected the topic of natural law ethics. This pushed the evangelical community toward extreme positions with regard to culture and an inability to speak to the great ethical questions of our time in a manner that is both true to the evangelical faith and understandable in a post-Christian society. This study is an attempt to regain the classical Protestant doctrine of natural law ethics, which also brings this topic into dialog with important developments in philosophy and the social sciences. It is motivated by a heart-felt desire for a new evangelical voice that is able to contribute responsibly to the moral foundations of western culture.

"Knowing and Enjoying the Gospel","e1828e95-063b-064e-ed68-595f415ac544","Quite often Christians are asking what’s the matter in our churches. They sense there is something wrong with the proclamation of the gospel but they cannot fathom what. The point is that the humanistic zeitgeist, i.e. the contemporary line of thinking has crept in unawares. What’s more, it has adapted itself to the gospel of Christ in such a way that Bible passages, whilst still being in use, are interpreted one-sidedly. As a result, the gospel is distorted or even turned upside-down at times. Because this has a devastating effect on the health of our faith, this book wants to urgently contribute towards discovering the foundational truths the gospel itself is based on. Of course, pastor Wegert employs the Bible as a guideline in going back to school, so-to-speak. He also delves into the principles of the Reformers and preachers of great revivals who took Scripture for what it was. Such people include, for instance, Martin Luther and John Calvin, J. Edwards, C. H. Spurgeon und Martin Lloyd-Jones.

"John Warwick Montgomery’s Legal Apologetic","3d48e8b8-7a40-61fa-7069-595f41f74d0c","Dr Montgomery is one of our leading Christian apologists. His writings have influenced several generations of apologists from around the globe. His debates are legendary. This book purports to break new ground apologetically as it assesses Dr Montgomery’s work. It focuses on his legal/historical apologetic and in the process reframes it for both for the ‘tough minded’ and the ‘tender hearted’. It shows not only the rationality of Montgomery’s work but also that his writings pave the way for an apologetic to New Age followers and to those who place experience before reason. A special feature of this analysis concerns Montgomery’s apologetic insights on the occult and paganism. This book also breaks new ground as the legal apologetic model has not been previously assessed; it illustrates that a juridical apologetic style has a rich history dating back to the Gospels themselves. The present work should thus be of particular interest to apologists, theologians, philosophers of religion, pastors, and all who are concerned to share the legal/ historical fact of the Resurrection of Jesus – together with its relevance – in a secular age.

Its purpose is to help us reflect on the very foundation of our Christian faith. In short, it takes us all the way ‘back to the roots‘. We will be looking at such crucial questions, as: what really is faith and conversion? What is the significance of getting baptized? What is characteristic of a Christian congregation? What does the Bible say about prayer and the Lord‘s supper? I‘m afraid we cannot deal with all the questions of faith in this booklet; but then, this is not so much a piece of theological literature for scholars. It is rather a brief compilation of the most important nuggets of information and a hands-on guide on issues like how to get your faith started, developed and fed by the Spirit for a lifetime.

Among Muslim non-theologians, there prevails only a vague knowledge about how these changes were undertaken and to which Biblical statements they are supposed to apply. Muslim theologians, on the other hand, attempt to corroborate the Islamic dogma of the falsification of the Biblical texts with arguments from the historical-critical exegesis of the Bible as practiced by Christian theologians.

Leaving someone’s home without eating is very painful. Among the Samia of Uganda there is the proverb “olwiho luba munda”, which is literally translated, “Relationship is in the stomach.” In Luganda a tribe in central Uganda, the proverb is “olugenda enjala teruda”, which means, “If a visitor leaves your home hungry he or she will never come back.” This suggests that eating is a very integral part of hospitality in Uganda. Because of the importance of hospitality, emphasis is put on making sure things are done as culture demands. The focus of hospitality however, is directed towards meeting the needs of the guest…

The first section of Apologetics focuses on Historical Apologetics (You can trust the Bible. In the Bible, Jesus claimed to be God. He proved it by rising from the dead), as well as Cultural Apologetics (cultural, philosophical and moral issues from an intelligent Christian perspective). We finish the apologetics section by surveying 22 world religions and cults. The next section covers Church History from the book of Acts to present day. The focus is on major events, people, terms, and themes every disciple maker should know. Finally the section covering spiritual warfare gives a balanced perspective of the spiritual conflict that all believers face in the battle against the world, the flesh and the devil. By the end of this book, the TTI disciple maker will have a clear and strong defense of the faith, a better understanding of the history of Christianity through the ages, as well as confidence to face spiritual warfare in the authority of Jesus Christ.

"The Power of an Undivided Life","8f196211-5503-5fb7-ebd9-596d7d6530c8","In this article, Scott Allen shows how the Biblical concept of wholism holds the power to free us from a debilitating mental dualism and enable us to enjoy embodied human life in all its wonder. It liberates us to explore vocational alternatives outside of “full time Christian service” and still know that we are both serving and glorifying God. As churches gain a wholistic perspective, they begin to infiltrate the culture, taking with them the power of God’s Word lived out in human flesh.

Intolerance and violence through racism includes slavery, national socialism in Germany, apartheid in South Africa, or the genocides in Rwanda and Bosnia. But racism is not only wrong theologically, it is not only against the dignity of humans, that guarantees their human rights, but newer genetic research also proves that the whole classification into races is without foundation. Biologically speaking all humans belong to one race. E.g., when you need a blood transfusion, you should not look for a blood donor from your “race”, but someone with the same blood group transcending all “races”.

"Sovereignty and Responsibility","d1cdbb41-0cca-565b-587c-596da65636d7","Sovereignty and Responsibility has been the topic of theology and philosophy for nearly 2000 years. Can there possibly be said anything new on this topic? Has not everything been said before? Can anyone surpass Augustine, Luther or Wesley? And if the author from his personal theological tradition as a leading Reformed Systematic theologian stands on one side of the old fight between Calvinist and Arminian Christians, why should that be of any relevance? I am convinced that this book is a breakthrough on the topic of Sovereignty and Responsibility. On the one side the author is very old-fashioned, using the Bible as the governing source of theology and being deeply rooted in historical theology. But his emphasis on the Bible at the same time makes him very modern and innovative, because he is not content with playing Scripture off against Scripture, as is often the case in the debate. He wants to listen to the biblical arguments of others and examine himself very thoroughly to make sure that he has taken into account their Biblical arguments. The Church of Christ has to battle for theological unity and cannot leave out certain biblical elements and revelations, because they do not fit into traditional theological systems. Henry Krabbendam has done the Church a major favour by asking the question, whether we really have built our Systematic theology on the whole Holy Scriptures.

"John Warwick Montgomery’s Legal Apologetic","2ea2f89b-d433-3ce5-53cd-596da6dabb7b","Dr Montgomery is one of our leading Christian apologists. His writings have influenced several generations of apologists from around the globe. His debates are legendary. This book purports to break new ground apologetically as it assesses Dr Montgomery’s work. It focuses on his legal/historical apologetic and in the process reframes it for both for the ‘tough minded’ and the ‘tender hearted’. It shows not only the rationality of Montgomery’s work but also that his writings pave the way for an apologetic to New Age followers and to those who place experience before reason. A special feature of this analysis concerns Montgomery’s apologetic insights on the occult and paganism. This book also breaks new ground as the legal apologetic model has not been previously assessed; it illustrates that a juridical apologetic style has a rich history dating back to the Gospels themselves. The present work should thus be of particular interest to apologists, theologians, philosophers of religion, pastors, and all who are concerned to share the legal/ historical fact of the Resurrection of Jesus – together with its relevance – in a secular age.

This last group perceives in the mere existence of Christians on Turkish soil an immediate assault which threatens to undermine the unity and character of the Turkish nation, and this threat becomes unbearable when Christians proclaim their faith.

He proposes a more nuanced definition of persecution, illustrating how it differs from suffering. He shows that persecution is normally the result of a complex combination of factors. And he correctly points out the need for Christians to be more reflective about the role of persecution, both in their own lives and around the world.

Isaiah Majok Dau from Sudan addresses how to face human suffering from a biblical and theological perspective. Rolf Hille from Germany contributes a biblical-theological response to the problem of theodicy in the context of modern criticism of religion. Charles L Tieszen from the United States attempts a comprehensive definition of persecution from a theological perspective which is communicable with a sociological perspective. Margaretha N Adiwardana from Brazil, a Chinese-Indonesian who left her country of birth due to harassment, examines the biblical teaching on perseverance. She maintains that from an eschatological perspective, suffering leads to blessing for those who endure it. Josef Ton from Romania, retired in the United States, describes suffering and martyrdom as a defining and essential Christian characteristic, with the major example being Christ’s death on the cross. Young Kee Lee, a South Korean now living in the United States tries to trace God’s mission in suffering and martyrdom. He postulates that there is a kind of suffering that is instrumental in advancing God’s kingdom. Thomas J Wespetal, a theological lecturer in Ukraine, from the United States deals with how God’s plan is furthered through the martyrdom event and attempts to highlight the value of dying for the Christian faith. Christof Sauer, a German living in South Africa, analyzes the work of the influential German mission leader Karl Hartenstein (1894-1952) who has developed a “theology of mission under the cross”. He maintains that suffering and martyrdom characterize the mission of the church which takes place in the interim between Christ’s ascension and second coming. Thomas Schirrmacher from Germany addresses a variety of theological and ethical issues. One of his emphases is on the sustaining role of the Holy Spirit in suffering and martyrdom. Peter Beyerhaus, also from Germany, was given the task to focus on an eschatological perspective, concerning the church of Christ in the shadow of the approaching Antichrist. According to his opinion present day persecution can be regarded as a foreshadowing of the apocalyptic escalation of persecution. Reg Reimer from Canada and with lifelong experience in advocacy in South-East Asia, shares his insights on persecution, advocacy and mission at the beginning of the 21st century. Richard Howell from India, dealing with the recent killings of Christians in Orissa, maintains that forgiveness and reconciliation are proper Christian responses to suffering and martyrdom.

"Paul in Conflict with the Veil","e8b4651b-5885-4c04-d402-596dc561ebf9","Exegetical examination of 1 Corinthians 11,2-16, following an alternative view of John Lightfoot, member of the Westminster assembly in the 16th century. Schirrmacher argues that from the biblical teaching that man is the head of woman (1 Cor 11:3) the Corinthians had drawn the false conclusions that in prayer a woman must be veiled (11:4-6) and a man is forbidden to be veiled (11:7), and that the wife exists for the husband but not the husband for the wife (11:8-9). Paul, however, rejected these conclusions and showed in 11:10-16 why the veiling of women did not belong to God’s commandments binding upon all the Christian communities. After stating the thesis and presenting his alternative translation and exposition of 1 Cor 11:2-16, he considers the difficulties in the text, presents his alternative exposition in detail (in the form of thirteen theses), discusses quotations and irony in 1 Corinthians, and deals with other New Testament texts about women’s clothing and prayer and about the subordination of wives.

When a Muslim mentions ‘prayer’, he generally means the mandatory ritual prayer, which he repeats five times daily. Ritual prayer is called “salat” in Arabic and must be performed daily at specific times by every adult Muslim, men and women, in Arabic, while facing Mecca.

"Is Multiculturalism (Multi-Culti) at an End? The Lack of an Alternative to the Discussion of Values","ded149f3-5544-c954-6b7a-596eb80499b5","“Multi-culti” – a catchword we all know. A concept that today is looked at rather critically but, in past decades, was to a large extent a guideline for the shared life of Christians and Muslims in Europe, even if by far not everyone was aware of this premise. Multi-culti – a result of an historical development into which we have stumbled rather than consciously planned and controlled. A development that, in addition, resulted from the false intellectual premises that accompanied the contemplation of the migration of Muslim workers to Germany, as well as from indifference and ignorance.

"Is the Bible a Falsification?","acaf4073-65d2-c05a-e8cb-596eb868b007","Among Muslims today, the idea that the text of the Bible has been falsified has long been a part of common belief. It is assumed that the Old as well as the New Testament originally were genuine revelations from God, but that in the course of time they were altered and distorted by human beings. Among Muslim non-theologians, there prevails only a vague knowledge about how these changes were undertaken and to which Biblical statements they are supposed to apply. Muslim theologians, on the other hand, attempt to corroborate the Islamic dogma of the falsification of the Biblical texts with arguments from the historical-critical exegesis of the Bible as practiced by Christian theologians.

The differences in the circumstances of life created by the urban or rural environment are too large; the gap between women in Afghanistan and Tunisia, between sternly religious families and secularized Muslims in the Western world, is too great. The question whether the woman concerned obtains access to schooling changes the circumstances of her life just as decisively as does her age at marriage and the view of the individual family about which Islamic regulations are to be applied in this family and how strictly. This article names several of these fundamental guidelines without, thereby, claiming automatically to describe the concrete living conditions of all Muslim women.

This report is an attempt to recover and restate this perennial intimacy as it seeks to bring a Christian understanding and an evangelical commitment to tackling some of the social, cultural and political challenges of contemporary society. It also provides an opportunity and some tools (what follows is by no means exhaustive) to reengage the Church and Christian leaders in the big conversation about active citizenship and social responsibility as central to the mandate to be “salt and light” and stewards of God’s creation.

"Let’s Strengthen Marriage","93c009ea-a983-27f2-7488-596ecad211a6","Goals 1. To represent a deeper understanding of marriage based on the Biblical teaching for it and to realize the importance of this institution; 2. To enrich Christian marriages; 3. To find other good Christian practices focused on marriage and to apply them to our circumstances; 4. To reach families at risk and to provide them with spiritual, emotional and practical support; 5. To develop an ongoing program that addresses and deals with the problems of marriage; Program Day 1 1. Introducing the problems; showing the statistics and the sad tendencies that are observed in the marriages in Bulgaria. This way of beginning the marriage week is very important because those who are not Christians are open to facts and statistics and it is a way to raise and keep their interest towards the continuation of the event. I have already looked at the various matters above and will not go in details here. During this day, it is important to deal with the meaning of marriage, to compare the secular and Christian definition, and to see that it is impossible to talk about marriage without mentioning its creator who is God himself. This is going to be the introduction to the Christian basis of marriage and the Bible based solutions of the problems mentioned before that. 2. The nature of marriage. What is marriage? Usually, under marriage we understand union between man and a woman, marked with emotional and physical communication and is contracted before the state in accordance with the respective legislation of the specific country. However, keeping the public and law requirements does not make the marriage Christian or Biblical. Every sort of marriage contract, acknowledged by the society and the state is just a form while marriage is much more than just a form. The Bible gives us some guidelines in defining marriage as such and in the way it was meant to be. Firstly, marriage in the light of the Bible is sacred and long union between two people who love each other and who made the mature decision to dedicate themselves to one another. Secondly, the Biblical marriage is union between a man and a woman. Third, the Biblical marriage is monogamous marriage. Fourth, the Biblical marriage is a lasting union. Fifth, basic point in the Biblical definition of marriage is the participation of God “So they are no longer two, but one. Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate."" (Mt.19:6) The idea for marriage is entirely of God and only in His presence and blessing it is possible a union between man and a woman to become Biblical marriage. God is the one who joins, He joins two people in one. Day 2 1. The purpose or function of marriage Does it mean that a marriage, which was started according Biblical way makes it ultimately Biblical for the entire life? The Biblical marriage or the Christian marriage is determined as such based on the aim that it has and the functions that it fulfills. PURPOSE 1 of the marriage and family “to be one flesh” – Genesis 2:22-24 The reason for many families to break is the lack of attachment, unity between the man and the woman. They are simply not one! For this to happen there are 2 steps needed – leaving (father and mother – the closest people) and attaching. PURPOSE 2 – the happiness of the spouse In the very beginning of marriage, God himself says in Genesis 2:18 “it is not good” – it is not nice for him, not happy, not useful for the man to be alone. God created the marriage and the family for mutual complementarity where the man and the woman find their true happiness, fullness and personal development. PURPOSE 3 – bearing and bringing up children, Genesis 1:28 The understanding and fulfilling of this part of the purpose of marriage is highly neglected in the Bulgarian families. Most of them would give excuse with their finances or the social instability. However, they are in conflict with the purpose of God for their marriage. However, the meaning of bearing children is not just reproducing man fellows. There is a much higher purpose – to bring your children up. This starts from an early age – Proverbs 22:6 Useful tools for the family towards this are: - The Word of God – Deuteronomy 6:6 - Discipline – Proverbs 13:25 - Joint prayer and worship

"Religion in Conflict","84885abe-74ab-92cf-45a9-597002a7def3","We live in a world of unimaginable horrors: nuclear weaponry, religious prejudice, and ideological hatred. With such horrors comes a sense of urgency and a moral imperative for us to raise the question, what is the purpose of religious language? Because religious statements are considered truthful by a people; they allow their lives to be shaped by them and project a world they would like to inhabit. At times societies employ religious language to gain moral sanction for the acts of violence. However the Church in its transformational mission is duty bound to encourage and employ the biblical metaphors of reconciliation and blessing. Religious language is meant to do something. This brings us to the question of power, which undeniably shapes our individual and social behaviour. The purpose of religious language is to use all available intellectual and intuitional means to interpret the nature of ultimate reality and to invite the human race to share in the privileges of a personal relationship with God. But religious language has also been used to justify violence.

"Channels of Hope Igniting a Movement to Transform Communities","b9f3b0a8-1682-e460-d1b7-5970198a1b17","Channels of Hope (CoH) is the way World Vision mobilises community leaders—especially faith leaders-- to respond to core issues affecting their communities—such as HIV and AIDS, maternal and child health, gender equity and gender-based violence, and child protection. Channels of Hope is more than just training or education. It is life transformation. Training is designed to move the heart, inform the mind and motivate a sustained and effective response to significant issues. Faith leaders trained by CoH become active participants in their communities and are committed to identify and support the most vulnerable in their communities. They mobilise their own congregations and seek to strengthen existing community structures. If community support structures do not exist, these leaders often mobilise and launch community coalitions, also known as Community Care Coalitions or Community Child-focused Coalitions (CCCs), which are groups of community volunteers committed to identify and support the most vulnerable children and adults in their communities.

Christians are to be convinced of God’s love for them and yet often struggle with doubts. After the doctrine of justification, no truth deepens our certainty and experience of God’s love as much as understanding our adoption in Christ. It has a convincing effect on the soul. J. I. Packer has written, “The truth of our adoption gives us the deepest insights that New Testament affords into the greatness of God’s love.” This workshop explores this insight and its implications for every Christian and pastor.

""The Holiness of God examines the meaning of holiness and why people are both fascinated and terrified by a holy God. This series closely explores God’s character, leading to new insights on sin, justice, and grace. The result is a new awareness of our dependence upon God’s mercy and a discovery of the awesomeness of His majestic holiness. R.C. Sproul says, 'The holiness of God affects every aspect of our lives — economics, politics, athletics, romance — everything with which we are involved.'""

"7 Truths About Hell","b660cbf5-d6cd-9215-4b1d-597ab6f905e8","Concerning hell, C. S. Lewis once wrote, “There is no doctrine which I would more willingly remove from Christianity than this, if it lay in my power.” In many ways, I agree with him. No one, Christians included, should like the idea of hell. Those of us who believe in hell aren’t sadists who enjoy the idea of eternal suffering. In fact, the thought of people I know who are outside of Christ spending eternity in hell is heartbreaking. As a young Christian, when I began to learn about hell and its implications, I almost lost my faith. It was that disturbing.

"4 Ways Satan Uses Christian Generosity for Evil","cb9a5603-7a91-8f11-a734-597eda134c4f","Western Christians today are the wealthiest Christians in history, and many of them are very generous. It’s estimated Christians around the world will give $57 billion to global missions in 2017. While we can argue over whether Christians are generous enough, for now let’s agree a lot of money is donated in the name of Jesus, and much of it comes from believers in the West.
Whether it’s small-town churches scrapping funds together through bake sales and car washes for a short-term mission trip, or large foundations funding building projects around the world, Christians want to see their money used for good. Yet too often their donations have an unintended effect.
I want to introduce you to four ways Satan has used Christian charity for evil. I’ve seen these examples firsthand, and there’s plenty of scholarship to back them up if you wish to do further study on your own.

"Poverty: World Hunger and Us","88ea0285-0928-63c4-992b-597ee2ff658f","I would like to talk about hunger. It may be that God is allowing physical hunger to ravage our globe in order to awaken his church to the worldwide (and local) ravages of spiritual starvation. Our hearts break more quickly when we see a skin-draped skeleton in its mother's arms than when we hear a missionary say: millions have never heard the gospel and are bound for hell in the wickedness of their worldliness or idolatry. Of course our heads tell us that it is much worse to be happy in this life and in torment for eternity than to be miserable only in this life. But visible earthly misery reaches our hearts more directly. Perhaps God is touching us this way in order that we might feel the horror of spiritual starvation when our heads declare: Do you weep over the suffering of these bodies now?—How much more, then, should you weep over the suffering of soul and body in eternity!

We explore the theology, sociology, and international influence of this popular but aberrant teaching. The Gospel Coalition International Outreach (IO) is partnering with African authors and publishers to create a resource that biblically examines the prosperity gospel and that will be distributed free across Africa and beyond. In Prosperity? Finding the True Gospel, African pastors Michael Otieno Maura, Ken Mbugua, and Conrad Mbewe are joined by John Piper and Wayne Grudem in pointing pastors and other Christians beyond the deceptions of prosperity theology to the true gospel of Jesus Christ. TGC-IO aims to raise $50,000 by July 1, at which time they will receive an all-or-nothing matching grant to complete the project.

"No Trinity, No Love","b9afd887-319f-8ed2-1d3b-598133b8e436","Love is the thing we all know we need. And yet love is the thing we struggle so much to get right. We think of it largely in terms of feelings, of “being in love” or “falling in love,” but feelings are fleeting. That kind of love certainly can’t be all we need; it’s so hard to maintain!
I remember some of the best love advice I ever got. It was right before my wedding, and my dad had taken me aside to encourage and pray for me. I jokingly said, “What if I fall out of love?” He returned my sarcasm, “Then you fall right back in!” My dad was really making the point that real love is not something you fall in and out of. It’s intentional. It has movement.
I think of this every time I’m attending a wedding and 1 Corinthians 13 is read. Many couples automatically go to this great “love chapter” simply because it’s all about love. But I don’t think many are paying much attention to what it actually says. Because when things start getting difficult, when conflict pops up—as it inevitably must in close relationships—suddenly keeping no record of wrongs and hoping and bearing all things doesn’t…

With the publication of The Son of God and the New Creation, Crossway is launching a new series titled Short Studies in Biblical Theology, edited by Dane Ortlund and Miles Van Pelt. The goal is simple: “to connect the resurgence [in] biblical theology at the academic level with everyday believers” (11).
To inaugurate such a series, what theme could be more fitting than Jesus, to whom all of Scripture points? And what author more fitting than Old Testament (OT) and hermeneutics scholar Graeme Goldsworthy, whose books (like According to Plan) have introduced biblical theology to so many of us?

"Talking About Jesus with America’s Least Religious Generation","1e5e4451-37a5-d75f-9e42-5981362065fa","Millennials, like the rest of us, are human beings. I know that’s not a terribly surprising thing to say, and I haven’t actually heard anyone deny that fact. But with the coming of age of each new generation, it seems there’s always a flurry of books and articles competing both for the honor of naming that generation and of describing what’s unique about them. And of course, so long as we’re okay using sweeping generalizations, each generation does tend to exhibit characteristics setting it apart from those who came before and will come after. Usually that has to do with the historical and cultural context in which they came of age. So one generation was deeply affected by the post-World War II world, the next by the upheavals of the 1960s and 1970s, the next by the Cold War, and on and on.

I’ll leave it to the professionals to do the work of describing exactly what’s affected millennials and how it’s affected them. As a Christian pastor, my task is to do the even harder work of reminding people—including millennials themselves—they’re not that different from the rest of us. The world has been around for a very long time, and the deepest problems plaguing millennials…

"How Can Jesus Be Our Everlasting Father?","19fb0ace-22ce-c1fa-8cc1-598137a0d68c","Few words in any language evoke the kind of feelings we have when we hear the word father. Some of us will feel a sense of loss this Christmas season, either because we had fathers who were wonderful but are no longer with us, or because we have unfulfilled longings for the kind of father we’ve never had. 

How comforting, then, to read of the birth of a child whose name shall be called “Everlasting Father” (Isa. 9:6). Under his care, his protection, and his provision, we are safe and will be satisfied for all eternity. 

Of all the names attributed to Jesus in Isaiah 9:6, Everlasting Father intrigues me the most because it’s the one I understand the least. How can Jesus the Messiah, the second person of the Godhead, be called Everlasting Father?

"The Jesus—and Book—We Missed","f3582786-f555-98cc-e37f-598137eff192","As a graduate student in literature in the 1980s, I was introduced to the critical school of new historicism. Initially I thought I’d be an advocate of this theoretical approach to literature. “After all,” I reasoned, “the more I know about the historical period that nurtured Sophocles or Virgil or Dante or Chaucer or Shakespeare, the better I will be able to analyze and appreciate their poetry.”


My hero and role model, C. S. Lewis, had taken such an approach in writing his A Preface to Paradise Lost, a seminal study that helped modern readers to understand Milton and his great epic in terms of Milton’s own beliefs and the beliefs of his age. Surely, Lewis’s approach would help open up new vistas as I dug into the great poetry of Wordsworth and Coleridge, Tennyson and Browning.

As it turned out, my enthusiasm was utterly misplaced. The new historicists didn’t share Lewis’s desire to understand Milton on his own terms. To the contrary, they taught we’re all—even and especially the great poets, artists, and prophets—products of our socioeconomic milieu. From their ultimately anti-humanistic point of view, Shakespeare wasn’t an inspired genius who rose above his spatiotemporal moment to touch on transcendent truth…

"How to Find Jesus in the Old Testament","39260b42-dd94-6b73-cda0-598138e5c3f4","Though he may be most noted for his work as a lawyer and political commentator, David Limbaugh’s recent interests have included topics related to Christianity. His most recent bestseller, The Emmaus Code: Finding Jesus in the Old Testament, is an attempt to demonstrate how Christ is the central message of the Old Testament.

Limbaugh’s breakthrough in understanding the Old Testament came when he understood the centrality of Christ within it, and he hopes this book will guide others toward the same appreciation of the Old Testament’s Christological witness. The title of the book is a reference to Luke 24:27: “And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, [Jesus] interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.” Limbaugh believes this text is in Scripture because God intends for all Christians to experience the kind of breakthrough those two travelers on the road to Emmaus experienced.

"The Word Made Flesh: Ligonier’s New Statement on Christology","e8dc331d-ea39-0239-9027-598138b7dae3","As Christians, we go by the name of Christ. He is our identity. We are ultimately defined not by our talents and background, as important as these may be, but by the fact that we are in Christ by faith. The person and work of our Savior establishes the entire scope of our salvation. He is the strong tower in which we receive shelter from the wrath of God, and he will restore all things under the reign of our Creator.

From the beginning of the Christian church, Christians have confessed an inseparable relationship between who Christ is and what Christ does. Who he is informs our understanding of his work, and what he does sheds light upon our understanding of his person. Consequently, any assault on the church’s understanding of the person or work of Christ affects the church’s understanding of Christ’s entire identity. Every controversy related to our salvation and what it means to be in Christ brings us face-to-face with our understanding of this identity, for our understanding of his person and work will determine the whole scope of our theology and practice. This theology deeply affects our lives, for it touches on our very hope of…

And how do we talk about true teachers who mistakenly counteract their own theology?
Defending the gospel against both its enemies and, at times, its friends is not easy. On the one hand, we desire not to be cowards; on the other hand, we desire not to be provocateurs.

In 2002 he published a 500-page book The Bible and Homosexual Practice: Texts and Hermeneutics. I put Dr. Gagnon on the line, peppered him with the following questions, and he kindly responded to each of them.

What role does the Church play in demythologizing sexuality in modern culture?
In the life of a professing Christian, what makes homosexual practice “an act of unbelief”?
Should we be okay with a professing believer who self-identifies as “a celibate gay Christian”?
What advice do you have for Christian parents who are fearful that their children will experience same-sex attraction in the teen years?
What are churches doing well in engaging those who struggle with same-sex attraction? What are churches doing poorly?
What guiding principles will help us to love and reach out to our homosexual neighbors?

"The Bible and Same-Sex Relationships: A Review Article","8abae7ee-cfcd-efd4-c490-59828a77e054","The relationship of homosexuality to Christianity is one of the main topics of discussion in our culture today. In the fall of 2013 I wrote a review of books by Wesley Hill and Sam Allberry that take the historic Christian view, in Hill’s words, that “homosexuality was not God’s original creative intention for humanity . . . and therefore that homosexual practice goes against God’s express will for all human beings, especially those who trust in Christ.” 
There are a number of other books that take the opposite view, namely that the Bible either allows for or supports same-sex relationships. Over the last year or so I (and other pastors at Redeemer Presbyterian Church in New York City) have been regularly asked for responses to their arguments. The two most-read volumes taking this position seem to be those by Matthew Vines and Ken Wilson. The review of these two books will be longer than usual because the topic is so contested today and, while I disagree with the authors’ theses, a too-brief review can’t avoid appearing cursory and dismissive. Hence the length. 
I see five basic arguments that these books and others like them make.

"Spiritual Friendship: Finding Love in the Church as a Celibate Gay Christian","cedcc897-67e7-f82d-2430-59828a6f091b","Wesley Hill is assistant professor of biblical studies at Trinity School for Ministry in Ambridge, Pennsylvania. Many will be familiar with his first book, Washed And Waiting: Reflections on Christian Faithfulness and Homosexuality (Zondervan, 2010), about his coming to terms with being (to use his terminology) a “celibate gay Christian.” Hill’s new book, Spiritual Friendship: Finding Love in the Church as a Celibate Gay Christian, charts how life has been in the intervening years, focusing on what’s become a prominent theme for him as he’s sought to find appropriate emotional intimacy as a single man with homosexual feelings: friendship. “Friendship,” he writes, “is a good and godly love in its own right, just as worthy of attention, nurture, and respect as any other form of Christian affection.”

Spiritual Friendship comes in two parts. The first examines where we are on friendship today, where Christian tradition has been in the past, and where the Bible would point us in terms of the importance of friendship. Part two is a call to revive the lost art of friendship, particularly the all-but-forgotten tradition of “spiritual friendship” in which two persons of the same sex make formal commitments and vows to one another. Hill ends with some pointers on how we…

"6 Things Christians Can Do About Same-Sex Marriage","cec747a5-a860-9241-9dfe-59828b4408dd","“It’s over,” he told me (John) grimly. “We’ve lost.”

These words came from a wounded warrior, a pastor who had dedicated much of his ministry to calling Christians to apply their faith in the public square and to opposing things like same-sex marriage. But his side, which he had spent so much time and energy defending, had been, he thought, definitively defeated. He was licking his wounds and wondering what to do.

Sentiments like these are not unusual, and we can sympathize with them. But we also hope they don’t last too long. The legal status of something alters neither its truthfulness nor its claim on our lives. As Christians, we are still responsible to the institution of marriage as God intended it, just as we are still responsible for unborn children, regardless of whether abortion is legal in a post-Roe v. Wade culture.

Informed and articulate Christians can make a difference in the same-sex marriage conversation. Yes, those hoping to promote natural marriage must overcome reputation liabilities, a firmly entrenched counter mindset, and the difficulty of presenting a winsome and reasonable case for our position. But we can, and we must, calmly and winsomely seek to make a difference.

Without any compromise of truth or grace, Christopher Yuan combines his life experiences with his training in the Bible in its original languages to bring a fresh and unique perspective on this sensitive issue.

"The Bible and Same-Sex Marriage: 6 Common But Mistaken Claims","3cccce0b-8714-e882-428b-5982904d6b8d","I’ve been hearing a lot in the public square about trajectories. In these conversations God’s Word is used to argue that the church needs to change its view on same-sex marriage, even though Scripture seems uniformly against it. This comes not only from newspaper columnists, such as Steve Blow in the Dallas Morning News, but also from evangelical commentators who claim the direction of the Bible takes them there. I understand this desire to love well, taken from the great commandment (Matt. 22:39), and I also see that one can ask such questions not out of a desire to rebel, clear a new path, or conform to culture, but out of sincerity.

Sincere questions deserve sincere responses. This article is designed to engage those who say the real thrust of the Bible is to joyously enter our brave new world with open arms and hearts. I’ll discuss various claims arguing that Scripture either doesn’t clearly address our specific contemporary situation or that Scripture is open and inconsistent enough to allow room for a category previously rejected.

"Same-Sex Marriage Will Affect the Pews Before the Pulpit","76e31062-7f69-9bf7-3385-598290e488be","The Supreme Court has asserted that the U. S. Constitution mandates all 50 states to license civil “marriages” between same-sex couples. You are a pastor who believes that God ordained marriage to be exclusively the union of one man and one woman. You know research shows that, on average, husbands and wives—and children raised by a married mother and father—are happier, healthier, and more prosperous than people in other living situations. 
What should you do now?
In the immediate term, the answer is “nothing different.” If you believe God ordained marriage to be the union of one man and one woman, you should continue to perform or host in your church only weddings that include both a bride and a groom.
The Supreme Court’s decision does not bind churches or clergy. It is about the licensing of civil marriages by the state. Religious weddings performed by religious institutions or leaders are an (almost) entirely separate question.

"Homosexuality","d40749da-9371-db24-9478-5982903ddcfc","In today’s society, we are told that homosexuality is a legitimate alternative lifestyle. Confusion still abounds, even in the church, about the nature of homosexuality. Rather than look to our own wisdom for a definition, perhaps we should ask—what does the Bible say a homosexual is? Do homosexuals really exist? That may seem like a strange question, but Dr. Sproul will help us understand some of the confusion surrounding the problem of homosexuality and will provide us with simple biblical responses to them.

"What I Learned from My Gay Co-Worker","780df323-e9a9-ab89-5027-598291711ef8","I have a friend (we’ll call him Mark) who can quote more Scripture than many pastors and rarely misses a worship service at his church. And he’s no passive participant, either. He often peppers his Facebook page with testimonials about the “Spirit’s work” during Sunday services. But on Monday mornings, back at work, Mark sports another testimony. With equal passion, Mark will plainly tell you he’s gay.
On most days when we worked together, Mark wore a Cheshire cat grin, looked in my direction, and made crude references to his private life. For months, I didn’t bite. Some might call my refusal to engage him cowardice, but snarky one-line comments were the only things that came to mind. Besides, I didn’t see the point in talking to someone who was so closed.
Though Mark had never taken the time to talk with me about anything not work-related, he knew I didn’t approve of his homosexuality. He saw me as the epitome of self-righteousness, hypocrisy, and bigotry. And in his eyes, my obvious but unspoken condemnation made me pathetic, bankrupt of “true” Christian love, the quintessential closed mind filled with hate. No point in talking with her.
Our standoff didn’t seem right, but I didn’t know…

"4 Questions on Same-Sex Marriage","8b19f825-fb7e-dffb-2e8a-598291dc573c","As same-sex marriage is now legal across the country, Christians will face scenarios that require a great deal of wisdom. But we warn you from the outset: we don’t have all the answers. These are uncharted cultural waters, and applying absolutes in the context of real-life relationships and a shifting culture is tricky. It makes a difference whether one is an employer or an employee, a close family member or a stranger on an airplane, a Christian or a non-Christian.
While there are some lines that believers ought not cross, there are some decisions that are matters of conscience. In 1 Corinthians, Paul says, “For why should my liberty be determined by someone else’s conscience? So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God” (1 Corinthians 10:29 and 31).
It will be difficult to wrestle through the specific situations believers will face in the days to come, so it is essential that we begin to have conversations about them now. We shouldn’t wait until the heat of the moment, but should be prepared with a gracious, thoughtful response. Let’s consider some potential scenarios.

"3 Existential Reasons Against Affirming Homosexuality","a930052f-2823-3593-435b-598296924de9","Like most Christians who haven’t made the shift to affirm the practice of homosexuality and same-sex marriage in the church, I’m persuaded to hold the traditional view by regular textual evidences. I’m a Christian and stand accountable to God and his revelation. I’m judged by it, not the other way around.
But an increasing number of Christians wish to accept the authority of the Bible while affirming homosexuality in the church. I’m not convinced of their reasons. The new books don’t have new arguments, just old ones already addressed. And the acceptance of homosexuality in the church seems to be read back into the Scriptures through cultural narrative and personal experience.

"Godliness Is Not Heterosexuality","a2fbe46b-5f80-9570-9fae-5982970e3319","I was recently on a panel talking about same-sex attraction at a large Christian conference. One of the questions I was asked was a thinly veiled version of the one question many Christian parents most want to ask me: “How can I stop my children from being same-sex attracted?” or (as no one has really had the courage to put it) “How I can I stop my child from becoming like you?”
It’s a revealing question. The number of times I’ve been asked it (always in roundabout ways) demonstrates how great a fear it is for many Christian parents—to raise a child who might be sexually attracted to their own sex. It’s not something they want to have to share in the Christmas letter in years to come—either openly or by what’s clearly left unsaid. 
The great hope is that they’ll be able to write of happy marriages, numerous grandchildren, and continued involvement in a good evangelical church. They don’t want to have to say instead that a child is gay, that…

"How I Discovered True Masculinity","781a2eae-2e51-0d70-b494-598299b0753b","My adolescence was a social nightmare. I grew up in the rural South but didn’t fit the mold of Southern masculinity in the slightest. Sports piqued no interest in me; roughhousing made me nervous; slaying innocent animals seemed cruel and gross. Of course I never expressed such blasphemies—I wasn’t stupid! But I was everything opposite of what my Duck Dynasty-like culture insisted I should be. I was sensitive. I liked to read. I liked to draw. I liked to journal. I wasn’t your mud ridin’, hog huntin’ kind of boy.
The nightmare cranked up to a Freddy Krueger level of horror when I realized I was attracted to the same sex. While my male peers were crushing on girls, I was crushing on them. I didn’t utter the word “gay” to describe myself until I was 19 years old, and no one prior to that time knew about my so-called sexual orientation. But I knew. I was painfully aware of how abnormal, unmanly, distorted, and screwed up I was, which made relating to other guys . . . well, I just didn’t relate to them.
You could see how this might make life a little scary for me.

I began to preach for them when they were a mission work and today sit in the same congregation as the pastor emeritus. Thankfully, my tenure was mostly peaceful, but I don’t know of any pastor who can remain long in one place and not face conflict. Some conflicts are well worth having, and some you cannot avoid. I have also learned that the way you fight is as important as whether you win or lose.

"7 Steps to Conflict Resolution","e451019f-1d93-c7a4-dc9f-59829fcaa25d","I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. These dear friends had labored with us in Bible study, outreach, prayer, and church planting. They had financially supported our collegiate ministry for years, and they had commended our work to others. And now this couple was maligning us with accusations not based in fact—at least insofar as I understood the facts—and picked up from people they had recently met. We never had a chance to defend ourselves.
Things escalated, and people chose sides. A few tried unsuccessfully to mediate the conflict. In the eyes of the primary couple, everything we did was now tainted with suspicion. In our eyes, they couldn’t do much that was right, either. My heart knew little but fear, anger, and self-justifying self-protection.
What can you do in such situations? When two or more sinful people draw near to each other, disagreements will surface. From time to time, these disagreements can lead to hurt feelings, tension, backbiting, and all-out opposition. If you’re not prepared, these situations will blindside you, and your heart’s vileness will only fuel the eruption.
But the Lord gave us detailed advice on how to handle explosive disagreements; it’s found in Philippians 4:2-9.

"Fear and Anxiety: 3 Ways Technology Makes Us Anxious","d958b3a6-bd75-357d-1784-5982d1cec384","When I was an elementary school kid, I worried. I remember my mom telling me, “You’re going to get an ulcer by the time you’re 15!” Once I became a Christian at age 19 and began reading passages like Matthew 6:25–34, I realized that my worry was a sin.
Since my conversion 20 years ago, worry and anxiety have skyrocketed for many, particularly in light of technological advances. We are constantly aware—via smartphones and other devices—of how horrible the world can be. Communication woes, identity theft, artificial social connections, and instantaneous bad news from around the globe are part of our daily intake.
As convenience and access to information increases, so does anxiety. Convenience and anxiety are two sides of the same coin and increase in tandem. While life might seem easier with every software update, it also becomes more terrifying for many because of the information we’re constantly receiving.
The great irony is we’re afraid to be without our technology, but our technology makes us afraid. The temptation to live with constant low-level panic is significant.
It’s possible, however, to engage our tech-drenched society while clinging to a biblical worldview. Here are three common problems—and gospel solutions—to address our technology-driven angst.

"Fear and Anxiety: Trust in God More than Medical Technology","dc366f9c-702a-8e13-e9dc-5982d15193bb","The patient, an elderly woman visiting her family for an extended stay from another country, had been experiencing pain in her leg for several months. One night the pain was unbearable, so her family took her to the emergency room. The physician, wanting to investigate if compression of a nerve in her back was causing the pain in her leg, ordered a CAT scan. The powerful images that looked inside her body revealed nothing unusual in her back but saw something in a completely different place. Though the findings, called “incidentalomas,” were small and nonspecific, the word abnormal appeared on the report. In these situations, the fear of something bad may be generated by the doctor, the patient, or both. In this case, the medical system reacted with fear, which ultimately led to three additional studies and a painful biopsy before all were assured this was nothing bad.
Besides the thousands of dollars spent to confirm “normal,” one other casualty of “too much” in this case was the patient’s actual concerns. In the pursuit of a normal test, the patient’s ongoing pain was completely neglected. Her final reaction to high-tech medical care revealed her frustration: “I’m going back to my own country, where…

Fueled by our fears, medicine makes promises it can’t keep based on a view of people that isn’t true. But what if health were a gift to nurture, not a possession to control? How would that change the way we pursue healthy living and form health care? This workshop will explore the consequences of seeing the good of health within the greater purpose of our God-given destiny.

"Every Disciple Making Disciples, Every Church Multiplying Churches","43f003e1-d528-955d-c576-598412fb733c","Jesus intends every disciple to make disciples, and he designs every local church to multiply other local churches. Yet somewhere along the way we have subtly and tragically taken the costly command of Christ to go, baptize, and teach all nations and mutated it into a comfortable call for Christians to come, be baptized, and listen in one location. The result is a rampant spectator mentality that skews discipleship across the church, stifles the spread of the church around the world, and ultimately sears the heart of what it means to be followers of Christ in local churches. This workshop explores corrective exhortations for us today based on New Testament principles and patterns for making disciples and multiplying churches.

"When the Wages of Sin Is a Grandbaby","eca489c5-a5fc-d1ba-169c-59881cbb515c","Her weeping came ahead of her presence, causing my heart to pound. As a mom of three, it wasn’t the first time a crying child had entered our bedroom hours after we thought they’d gone to sleep. My mind went racing through the evening, then over to her to find the trouble, so I could do what I’d done so many times: soothe the hurt, ease the fear, or comfort her in sickness. The familiar words tumbled quickly from me, “Baby, what’s wrong?” But I had absolutely no context for what she’d say next.
She’d just finished her first semester at college, had found a great job, had made sweet friends, and had found a place to serve in a local church she really liked. There wasn’t a mention of a young man yet, though her dad and I had smiled at the thought we could be a few short months or years from meeting him. But no matter where we thought her life was, her tear-filled words came nonetheless: “I’m pregnant.”

"Fathers, Lead Well in Your Homes","31930a99-7d0a-f43b-2c16-59881df5bd48","The description of David as “a man after God’s heart” was used first by Samuel when he informed Saul his kingdom would not continue. “The Lord has sought out a man after his own heart,” he told Saul (1 Sam. 13:14). Now, this does not mean David was perfect. Far from it. He was a strong-willed, sometimes impulsive man who accomplished great things and also had great failures. Sometimes we learn from him by example, and other times we learn from him by contrast.
Fathers, in particular, have much to learn about leadership from the life of David.

You end up with The Dadly Virtues: Adventures From the Worst Job You’ll Ever Love.
As the subtitle suggests, this book is a tongue-in-cheek portrait of the gory glory of fatherhood, containing plenty of side-splitting anecdotes and cultural critique with a dash of philosophical profundity. The editor, Jonathan Last, likens the book to “something of a Swiss army knife: part instructional guide, part meditation, part war journal” (4).

If ever there were a segment of our church body that we tend to exempt from the active participation of church membership, it’s families with young children. I write as a mother, in the throes of raising my three little ones (all younger than 5), and I understand the frenzy of Sunday mornings. Further, I know all too well the temptation to skip church when the kids are a handful, or worse, to resent the church when our expectations aren’t met.
Having young children has become a type of carte blanche, excusing us from regular attendance, service, hospitality, and evangelism. But I plead with you, mothers of little ones, don’t give up on your local church.

Questions like these are often asked in student ministry circles, but there’s one inherent issue with them all. They assume you (the youth pastor) are the key spiritual leader in the lives of teenagers, that parents are to help you in your ministry to their teens. But the Bible never makes this assumption. Rather, it assumes—and commands—parents be the key spiritual leaders in the lives of their teenagers.

While he was gone for the day, I painstakingly planned how I would reveal the wonderful news. That evening, we enjoyed a delicious dinner, followed by a cake iced in baby blue and pink. We then sat down to a favorite Jimmy Stewart movie in which his character’s wife also plans a special announcement.

As I cracked open Jessalyn Hutto’s small book, Inheritance of Tears: Trusting the Lord of Life When Death Visits the Womb, these words brought a surge of grief. Not only did I know what was coming intellectually—this is, after all, a book dealing with miscarriage—but I also know personally the sharp 180-degree turn from joy to heartbreak.
Like Hutto, when I went for an early ultrasound “the baby’s tiny form was there, but the reassuring sound of a heartbeat was missing.” A little over halfway through the first trimester my baby’s heart had stopped beating; two weeks later, I joined the ranks of so many who have experienced the pain of miscarriage.

The doctor had just laid out the cold, hard truth: “Your friend, Ken, has passed.” Ken was a dear family friend, a man my kids adored. A longtime staff member at the church I served as pastor, he died suddenly—at the church building, in the midst of his work. A heart attack ushered him into the arms of his Savior in an instant on that overcast fall morning. I was stunned. Our staff was stunned. The congregation was stunned. My children, who “helped him” regularly at the church while I sat in meetings, counseled members, or worked on sermon prep, would be most stunned of all. I planned my talk with them carefully and broke the sad news that evening.

For the third time in three years, I left a piece of my heart in a dorm room at a giant university hours from home. There’s only one chickie left in the nest that used to hold four, and his traitorously giant feet are dangling over the side of it. In a short time our nest will be empty entirely.
I walked through last week with a tape in my head chanting, “I miss them I miss them I miss them.” I thought of life after that last baby leaves and could conjure up no vision for what would come next. Meaningless, meaningless. I did the only reasonable thing: I attempted to fill the hole in my heart with cookies—a lot of cookies. I overreacted to things that normally wouldn’t have bothered me. The internal ache hurt so deeply and caused so much distraction that I once again had to face the ultimate Christian mommy-guilt question: Do I love my kids too much?

Created in God’s image, they were given the grand assignment to “be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and govern it.” They were to raise children who bore this same image, living in glad obedience to God. As their family grew, so would the boundaries of Eden. The whole earth would become a garden filled with offspring reflecting divine glory. 
But Adam and Eve failed to be what they were made to be. Their disobedience ushered in the reality of pain in childbearing—the pain of sinners giving birth to sinners.
Adam and Eve weren’t only the first human parents; they were the first to experience children raised in the same home turning out differently. They were the first to wrangle with sibling rivalry. They were the first to experience bereavement. Surely they were the first to wonder what they could have done differently so that things wouldn’t have turned out so terribly wrong.
But certainly they weren’t the last.

In this new six-minute roundtable, three women in different seasons of motherhood—Noël Piper, Kathleen Nielson, and Gloria Furman—talk about how they fight their own fears. Furman discusses the encouragement she receives from dwelling on Jesus and the role older women play in her life as a young mom.

Nielson shares how vital it is to have the gospel motivate her heart, rather than her own desires.

I immediately clicked with the core of kind and passionate teenagers, and we bonded over our love for theater and shared desire to create meaningful conversations on stage. We attended each others’ birthday parties, threw cast parties, and saw each other weekly at rehearsals.
But three years later I left the club, and things changed. The friendships began to fade. The glue that held our relationships together—drama—was gone, and without it our “close” friendships fizzled out.
In contrast, there’s Hannah. We’ve only met each other in person once, and she lives on the opposite side of the country, but I consider her one of my best friends. Our grandparents went to church together and set us up as email “pen pals” more than seven years ago (when we were 12).
Hannah is a fellow Jesus follower and encourages me with every email she sends.

Milla, short for Louise Mildred, had her first seizure at 2 years old. She was diagnosed with Batten disease, a rare and fatal disorder of the nervous system. A few weeks later, her younger sister, Elle, received the same diagnosis. (An older sister, Ann Carlyle, doesn’t have the genetic disorder.)
For the past three years, Frazer and Dana have hauled their two girls to doctors’ appointments, held them through seizures, and watched them lose dexterity. Elle was able to start an experimental medication regimen in September; for Milla, it was already too late.
She turned 6 on November 2. Twenty-four days later, her mother posted, “Milla is with Jesus. Blessed be the name of the Lord.”
While living out every parent’s worst nightmare, the Gieselmanns’ belief in God’s goodness was tested and stretched. Through countless nights waking up with the girls to one bad medical report after another, the couple leaned heavily on the faith passed down from their parents.
And they leaned on the church, hoping it would be there to catch them.

I’ve read the statistics. I’ve seen what technology use can do. But, like many other parents, I still wonder how best to use technology in our family, which is why I’m thankful for Andy Crouch. In his new book, The Tech-Wise Family: Everyday Steps for Putting Technology in Its Proper Place, Crouch provides a helpful framework for families in their quest to use technology wisely in their homes.
The volume is divided into three parts. The first (chs. 1–3) is about the decisions of a tech-wise family. The second part (chs. 4–8) gets practical, zooming in on daily life in the tech-wise family. The third part (chs. 9–10) is a sort of “where we want to be” section about how a tech-wise family focuses on what matters most. With his “Ten Tech-Wise Commitments,” Crouch—formerly at Christianity Today and now a senior strategist for communication at the Templeton Foundation—shows parents that technology use in the home doesn’t have to be shaped by the surrounding culture, but can be intentional and promote the flourishing of every family member.

You’ve been over and over this ground with them, but here you are again. You stand there, looking at them, barely holding on to your temper, wondering, What do I do now? What do I say?

Perhaps it weighs heavy on my heart because I was a rebellious child raised in a Christian home. But though nurtured in a spiritually and theologically solid environment, I ran from it—to spiritual darkness and sin—as fast as I could.
Not long after my conversion, people often asked me to reach out to their own children who were living prodigal lifestyles. I started to realize a few things as I brought the gospel to young adults strung out on pharmaceuticals, cocaine, acid, crack, meth, and MDMA. First, I realized how true my Calvinistic beliefs really were (unless the Lord—in sovereign mercy—redeems, all is hopeless); and, second, I realized most parents were at a loss to know how to pursue their rebellious child.

Many of the girls present were on the cusp of their teen years, and the majority of mothers were just beginning their foray into parenting teens.
After the girls went to a separate room for a follow-up discussion with youth leaders, moms’ hands darted up in the air. The urgency in each mother’s question expressed her anxiety over social media and other teen challenges. It was encouraging to see so many moms who wanted to be better equipped to navigate the teen years. Too often I see the opposite—parents resigned to the false “teens will be teens” notion that they give up trying.
But I’m not sure these moms were anxious for the right reasons.

"5 Principles for Disciplining Your Children","998cff50-0832-3f0f-72ac-598971b6fa89","Before having children, I worked for years as a camp counselor and as a teacher in a large public high school. Both arenas taught me the importance of discipline in a child’s development. Without structure and rules, summer camp would quickly devolve into some version of Lord of the Flies. Without order in the classroom, my students would never have the opportunity to learn.
Through my years of working with kids, five guiding principles helped me as a counselor, teacher, and especially as a mom. While not all methods work for all children, I’ve found these principles work for a variety of children, regardless of their age, sex, or disposition.

"5 Ways Teenagers Often Waste Their Time","df6e6892-d267-1646-1eeb-598971b4d2fc","Jonathan Edwards had an intense fear of wasting time. Like, scary intense. Reading his resolutions always sobers me. I mean, what 19-year-old writes, “Resolved, never to do anything, which I should be afraid to do, if I expected it would not be above an hour, before I should hear the last trump”?
But Edwards grasped something we too often don’t. He grasped that life is short and only meaningful if lived for God’s glory. He understood that wasting time is a symptom of taking our eyes off the gospel.
The problem is that we do take our eyes off the gospel, and that means we do waste time—especially us teenagers. Every day, in fact, we waste time. There are even certain time traps teens (even and especially Christian teens) fall into again and again. Let me show you five.

"Andy Crouch on How to Become a Tech-Wise Family","73b929fa-0894-b43d-9013-598972d041c6","In order to survive and even thrive in our information age, Andy Crouch believes the church must become more like a family, and the family must become more like a church. His new book, The Tech-Wise Family: Everyday Steps for Putting Technology in Its Proper Place [review], explains how wise, discerning handling of new-media technology will cultivate wisdom and courage. The home, he says, must limit technology in order to delight in God, neighbor, family, and nature. The church, he says, will not enjoy authentic community unless it disciples Christians in countercultural living when it comes to our TVs, video games, and smartphones.
Crouch joins me on this episode of The Gospel Coalition Podcast to discuss his new book, published by Baker with new insights and research from Barna. For more than 10 years, Crouch was an editor and producer at Christianity Today, where I got to know him. He served as executive editor from 2012 to 2016. He joined the John Templeton Foundation this year as senior strategist for communication. He is the author of several other books, including Strong and Weak: Embracing a Life of Love, Risk and True Flourishing [review], which won TGC’s 2016 book award in the category of faith and work. I spoke with him about parental peer pressure, family singing, Amish living, and more.

He writes graciously and gently. But his book will be persuasive only to those who already agree with him.

"Sexual Chastity: God’s Life-Giving Path for Unmarried Lovers","eb5adf0f-240d-8af7-aecb-598d51ed0af7","Martin Luther famously said that we’re all like drunk men on a horse, falling off to the left or to the right of the narrow path—the path of grace and truth—Jesus has paved for us. The fall to the right represents truth without grace, or religious moralism. The fall to the left represents grace without truth, or ethical license.
In the 1990s we might say that Western evangelicalism tended to fall to the right. For that decade and the few years that followed, the “Christian right” emphasized purifying society through strategic, largely law-based posturing in the culture wars. If enough Christians were in positions of power, the thinking went, society’s laws, norms, and values would eventually become more “Christian.”
The drift has reversed course ever since. If Christians could just forget the culture war mentality and focus on engaging culture, nurturing friendship, and being winsomely persuasive, the thinking goes, a better society would emerge.
Both approaches assume some risk. Falling to the right risks becoming alienated from culture due to a morality-based, us-against-them approach that emphasizes rules and rights over love. Falling to the left risks becoming so friendly with secular culture that we cease to be countercultural at all and instead become just like the culture.

"Truth Overruled: The Future of Marriage and Religious Freedom","20edaeec-ba33-7d5a-275d-598d5190c49a","When ThinkProgress blogger Zack Ford first published his review of Ryan Anderson’s new book, it bore the headline, “The Feeble Arguments Made by One of Marriage Equality’s Last Remaining Opponents.” That title has since been changed. It may have been too honest.
Not honest about Anderson’s work, which may fairly have been described with a thousand adjectives, none of which is “feeble.” And not honest about the number of us who understand what marriage actually is. Maybe ThinkProgress could sponsor a field trip to any of the dozens of states or 175 foreign nations that haven’t chosen to redefine marriage.
The headline epitomized with such brazen authenticity the hubris of the LGBT movement. Having successfully wrought one of the most significant reformations of cultural mores in history, liberal activists have moved ahead with an ironic agenda that threatens liberalism itself.

"enGendered: God’s Gift of Gender Difference in Relationship","99588e35-b468-63c1-abd5-598d5531494a","EnGendered: God’s Gift of Gender Difference in Relationship is a recent addition to that debate. Sam Andreades was a pastor in New York City and now serves in Quarryville, Pennsylvania. He founded Higher Ground, a New York City ministry for those with unwanted same-sex attraction (SSA). His book is the fruit of these ministries and research on gender distinction in marriage. This research involved interviewing Christian men in successful “intergendered” (heterosexual) marriages who’d previously been in “monogendered” (same-sex) relationships, on the assumption they’d be able to identify what gender difference contributes to relationships. These interviews, as well as interactions with secular and Christian studies on marriage, form a large part of enGendered. Andreades’s central thesis is that emotional intimacy is necessary for a successful marriage, and that gender difference is necessary for emotional intimacy.

"Christian Relationships in a Hypersexualized Age","a9e80757-d773-45d9-1d17-598d60cf500d","Within Divine Sex: A Compelling Vision for Christian Relationships in a Hypersexualized Age, Jonathan Grant presents a wide-angled-lens account of Christian sexual ethics within the context of contemporary culture. Rather than focus on discrete questions—he only lightly grazes on some of the fiercest prevailing controversies—Grant’s concern is to expose the nature of the shared cultural matrix from which they arise.
Grant, pastor of an Anglican congregation in New Zealand, writes from an acute awareness of the need for formational, rather than chiefly informational, responses to our sexual climate. Drawing on sources such as the work of Stanley Hauerwas and James K. A. Smith’s recent Cultural Liturgies project (see Desiring the Kingdom and Imagining the Kingdom), he argues our behavior is molded by a “social imaginary” that shapes our vision of the good, directs our desires, and fosters certain habits of thought and action. The sexual and religious landscape mapped by sociologists like Mark Regnerus and Christian Smith has distinctive dynamics, and Charles Taylor’s work on secularization and the contemporary self informs Grant’s perceptive insights into their logic and origin as they bear on our sexual selves.

Published before the Supreme Court’s same-sex marriage decision last year, California Polytechnic State University political scientist Ronald C. Den Otter addresses those “already convinced that our Constitution requires states to give marriage licenses to same-sex couples” (28). His goal is to change hearts and minds about the value of plural marriage. The same reasons requiring marriage be expanded to include same-sex couples should apply, he contends, to “throuples” and “moresomes” as well. 
Since restrictions based on gender and number treat citizens unfairly, Den Otter advocates for a marriage regime that would allow people to craft their own definitions of marriage. The government should provide citizens a “menu” of relationship possibilities.

"A Pastor Is Not Married to the Church","f3aafbbb-1576-e994-01e2-598d66e4611b","More than 10 years ago, on the Sunday when my husband—newly graduated from seminary—was being ordained as a pastor, a godly older man approached us. “Well,” he said gravely to my husband, “today is the day you marry this church.”
My heart sank. I was ready to be the pastor’s wife. But I wasn’t ready to be the pastor’s other wife.
I’m so thankful I don’t have to be.
Since that day, I’ve often heard the same myth repeated in various forms. Some are meant to encourage: “Thanks for sharing your husband with us. We’re glad he’s the husband of the whole church.” Some are sympathetic: “It must be hard to be married to a guy who’s married to the church.” And some are designed to minimize expectations: “Of course, a pastor’s wife has to realize her husband has two wives, and she can’t expect him to focus much on her.”

With biblical names like these, you’d think Isaiah and Naomi would be the ideal roommates. But we’ve noticed that Isaiah (who just turned 3) can be pretty moody, and Naomi (who just turned 1) has a powerful set of vocal chords. 
I love being a parent, and we have awesome kids. They give me so much joy. But it’s not always easy. Having kids permanently changes marriage. You try to have a conversation, and you’re constantly interrupted; you plan time to connect and you’re completely exhausted; you try to plan a date night and then realize how expensive a babysitter is. You get the idea.
Lately, I’ve been thinking about something my mom once said: being a parent, for all the strains it can put on your marriage, also allows your marriage to grow deeper and richer.

Before we walked out the door, we looked into each other’s eyes, and we kissed. Later, at lunchtime, we had a significant discussion about personal priorities for our finances. We also discussed our church. No one shouted or cried or clammed up. Later that evening, we ate dinner as a family. We laughed a lot. I did the dishes. He paid bills in the family room. After the kids were in bed, the two of us ended the day reading side by side on the couch.
Ours is the story of a happy marriage. 
We owe this happiness to the grace and mercy of our Lord. And one of his loving means has been our place in the local church. 
When yet another pastor falls publicly into grievous, soul-bruising, family-destroying sin, onlookers can quickly line up to blame life in the church. I’ve read many articles in recent months that claim ministry life makes pastors and their wives inherently lonely, hypocritical, distracted, vulnerable to sin, or prone to cracking from stress. The cumulative message is clear: When failure happens, it’s the church’s fault. 
I know ministry life can bring unique, and sometimes intense, challenges to family…

Few husbands understand the full nature of their calling, instead imagining themselves to be joined to their wives merely for the pleasures of romantic affection, common interests, and raising kids. To a degree this is true, but there is far more to marriage than mutual fulfillment. In the Bible, husbands and wives unite for a purpose beyond themselves: to spread God’s glory in a dark world.
And it’s especially the husband who’s called to stoke that glory.

"Waiting on the Prodigal Spouse or Child You Love","f41f7e1b-5dc4-afd1-92d1-598d6b12146f","Lynn and her husband had been married for 12 years when she started to realize there was something re­ally wrong with her marriage. She didn’t suspect an affair at first because she couldn’t believe her husband, a professing Christian, would violate his marriage vows. He was a doctor and often worked late, but one Christmas Eve, he didn’t come home at all.
That Christmas was the start of years of unfaithfulness, sepa­rations, and attempts at reconciliation. Lynn’s husband would lie about his affairs, making it nearly impossible to tell when, if ever, his repentance was real. Lynn vividly recalls sitting with him at a coffee shop where he asked her to forgive him for his infidelity, all the while knowing his plan after leaving was to go and sleep with another woman.
Lynn prayed for her husband to repent. They went through hundreds of hours of counseling sessions. She could have divorced him early on, but her heart’s desire was for their relationship to be restored and their family made whole. She didn’t just want him to stop having affairs and start living an upright life. She longed to know his heart. But he didn’t want to be known. Instead, he betrayed her again and again.

"10 Temptations Facing an Elder’s Wife","3929f143-561d-465a-da65-598d6bc971ae","Puritan pastor Thomas Brooks gave thanks for the prayer life of his wife, Martha. Even when poor health demanded she be in bed, Martha instead collapsed into a corner of her home to pray. One biographer concluded the success of Brooks’s ministry was due to the faithfulness of his wife. I know many pastors, including myself, who would say the same thing.
Elders’ wives are the unsung heroes of the local church.
Husbands depend on their prayers, and congregations depend on their labor. They may teach children, lead women’s ministries, organize neighborhood Bible studies, practice hospitality, write books, or counsel the downhearted. Their ministries differ depending on their desires, their gifts, and the church’s needs. But they all support a man who has been called to shepherd a local church.
Having served on the elder body of three different congregations, I know firsthand the temptations elders face, but I’ve also seen how the wives of elders can struggle. Many of the following temptations are common to all Christians, but I’ve written them with elders’ wives in mind. My purpose is to encourage these women to persevere and to inform the prayers of the congregations who love them.

A friend of mine, who lives too far away, contacted me to say he was struggling to understand how the cost of singleness as a Christian could possibly be worth it. As far as he could see, an illicit relationship would be “the only possible way for me to enjoy the relational intimacy I’ve dreamt of my entire life.” He concluded, “I cannot imagine the shell of a life I would live without somebody standing by my side.” In the light of this deficit of intimacy, could singleness ever be worth it?
My friend isn’t alone. In my own church family, one of the biggest causes of people drifting away from Christ has been entering into illicit relationships, especially single Christian women with unbelieving men. For many of them, the assumption was that life as a single just wasn’t viable. They needed intimacy.
It has become an unquestioned assumption today: Singleness (at least godly singleness) and intimacy are alternatives. A choice to be celibate is a choice to be alone. No wonder for so many this seems too much to bear. Can we really expect someone to live without romantic hope? It sounds so unfair.

"Marital Sex Is Creation Care","6c6f80b6-bb70-dab9-3f97-598d6cfcfa78","According to a 2010 Pew Research Center study, Millennials are more accepting of living together without the benefit of marriage than their older contemporaries are. Only one in five Millennials is married today (half the percentage of their parents’ generation at the same stage), and there is a marked increase in the number of unwed parents. By contrast, the same study notes, “Protecting the planet is a multi-generational cause these days. Most Millennials recycle and try to buy green products, but the same can be said of adults of all ages.”
It’s popular to believe in creation care. It’s unpopular to believe sex belongs in marriage. But I’d like to suggest that marital sex deeply connects with creation care. Rather than seeing these as totally separate issues, we should think of marital sex as creation care.

Its slightly larger than a teaspoon and has a large hole in the middle, making it incapable of holding—let alone carrying—the sort of substance that typically requires a spoon. My friend keeps it in his sugar bowl, waiting for unsuspecting guests to attempt productive engagement with it. Some will quietly (but unsuccessfully) persevere with it, not wanting to make a fuss and assuming the fault must somehow lie with them. Others will immediately declare the spoon is ridiculous and insist on something better suited to the task at hand.
The spoon, it turns out, is actually an olive spoon. The hole in the middle is to drain the fluid as you lift the olive to your mouth. And so the lesson for us is this: You can’t make sense of the way the spoon is without understanding what it’s for.

Marriage is “one of the most precious relationships God gives us,” Akin says. “It involves the hardest work and the greatest commitment of any relationship I have.” Akin also relates how often husbands desire to make their wives a replica of themselves. Núñez shares how it’s a temptation for husbands to “fix” their wives rather than acknowledging that only God can fix both husband and wife.

Ernie K. Doe’s song “Mother-in-Law” soared to the top of the popular music charts in 1961. “This song will last to the end of the earth,” he predicted, “because someone is always going to get married.”
Mothers-in-law have been a source of marital strife and the brunt of men’s jokes for years, but the relationship between mothers and daughters-in-law can be even more fragile. We both need the gospel, and complicated relational dynamics should drive us to Jesus. 
When Paul directs older women to train younger ones, Paul is specific about what sort of person we older women ought to be: “reverent in behavior” (v. 3). We can’t maintain that stance while focused on ourselves.
Am I approaching my daughter-in-law with a sense of entitlement, pointing her to my personal preferences, or am I pointing her to Christ?

But he hasn’t fallen—he’s been thrown. As he falls, the group’s leader looks angrily at the others. “Well, is there anyone else here whose needs are not being met?”
This is a mischievous but timely critique of a culture in which we expect everything—including our marriages—to meet our needs.
When we approach marriage expecting our needs to be met, we fail to understand the real nature of love, and we sow seeds of marital destruction. God hasn’t designed marriage as a means to meet our personal needs. Assuming marriage is about meeting needs is dangerous for at least two reasons.

"My Brother Saved My Parents’ Marriage","1ac073b1-5cc4-e8c1-5fef-599100c726f7","We approached the Golden Arches on Ann Arbor Road, and Dad turned on his blinker. Each Wednesday night after youth group, the high schoolers met up at McDonald’s. I didn’t yet have my license, so he drove me. As I went to open the door, he tried to start a conversation.
“Caitlin?”
“Yeah?” I responded, eager to get out of the car and join all my friends inside.
“Sweetheart, we know why Mom has been so sick.” 
At this my heart beat faster. For several years my mom had suffered with health issues, and recently she’d been bedridden. We didn’t know what the problem was. I nodded, urging him to continue.
“We’re pregnant.”
I couldn’t have heard him right.
“You’re what?”
“I know, it’s a shock to us too. We’re pregnant.”
My mind raced. I should feel happy. Mom’s okay; we’re going to have a baby in the house. I love babies. But all these thoughts were mired in embarrassment: Now all my friends would know my parents were having sex! I was mortified.

"Respecting Husbands","78faa9b5-6682-01a1-5f7f-599101396a7f","Peter calls for “respectful and pure conduct” from wives (1 Pet 3:2), and Paul clearly teaches: “Let the wife see that she respects her husband” (Eph 5:33). What is meant by this kind of respect, according to the Scriptural context? What does respecting one’s husband look like, day to day—even when respect seems undeserved? What are the challenges—and blessings? How does the response of a wife to this call offer witness to all those around her? How do these words apply to diverse cultures and situations? This workshop panel will offer honest discussion and encouraging words from experienced wives.

"Before You Marry, Question Your Relationship","2ec5f367-7b10-ab04-6761-59910162ff6d","Since my divorce, people have asked me over and over again: “Were there any red flags when you two were dating?” The truth is: not any glaring ones. 
I know that isn’t what people want to hear. They want a way to ensure the person they marry won’t disappoint them. Fail them. Become someone else. But when you get married, as Elisabeth Elliot points out, “you marry a sinner.” You commit yourself to a fallible person and an unknown future. If you are also committed to walking in obedience and pursuing God’s glory, when disappointments and trials come in marriage, you can cling to the God who never fails or forsakes his children.
But though none of us can predict the future, there is wisdom in asking questions of your relationship before committing to marriage. How your significant other treats the waitress who serves you dinner, interacts with people at church, spends their time, treats your purity, and uses their money are all indicators of the kind of spouse they will likely be.
When we’re wrapped up in romantic feelings, it can be hard to see clearly. If we’re honest, sometimes we don’t want to see clearly, since it might mean we need to end a relationship we enjoy or say goodbye to someone we love. But if we love God and his Word, we will seek his wisdom (James 1:5).
One way to seek his wisdom is to ask certain questions about the person you’re with. Here are seven.

"The Lesson That Saved My Marriage","cba09eda-e23a-257a-8693-5991022eeca6","Soon after getting married I read an article about a husband’s responsibility to love his wife. The author described a wife who is “nourished and cherished” by her husband, using words like “glowing,” “flourishing,” “satisfied,” “content.” This wife sounded quite wonderful. So did her husband. I, on the other hand, felt off—worn out and lost in the shuffle of needy children and duties at home. I loved my husband, but our marriage was far from “glowing” as we struggled with communication and unmet expectations.
So, naturally, I concluded it was all his fault.
He’s not nourishing and cherishing me, I would lament. I’d count down the moments until he arrived home from work, waiting for him to burst in the door and rescue me from my failures and frustrations. When he didn’t live up to my demands, I gave into despair. I tagged him “in” and checked myself “out.”

"Encouraging the Not-Yet-Married","56ff4431-8b38-b705-d144-59910334776b","On a cold January night in 2003, I was in Denver, Colorado, for a Campus Crusade winter conference. All the cool kids wore Abercrombie and had flip phones, and under the influence of Joshua Harris’s book about relationships, I had kissed dating goodbye.
After dinner that night, I spoke with a girl named Brooke about dating—I mean courting—and whether God had marriage in our future. He did, and we’ve been married for a dozen years.
A lot has changed in the last 15 years. Crusade is now Cru. Having a flip phone might be cool, but in a retro kind of way. Yet for all the changes, much stays the same. Whether you call it dating or courting or something else, the “way of a man with a young woman” (as Proverbs puts it) is still a beautiful, mysterious thing, like a ship sailing across the sea (Prov. 30:18–19).
But like the high seas, dating can be dangerous, leaving people with bitter and broken hearts.

"6 Surprises Every Premarital Counselor Should Cover","9dff7ed5-8e80-6477-e07c-599103626008","Kimm and I had one premarital session before our wedding. It lasted maybe five minutes, just long enough for the well-meaning counselor to hand us a crate of cassettes and urge us to listen. We threw them in the trunk. One day, nine months later, he wanted them back. Not a problem, since they were right where I left them—in the trunk, unopened and unused.
It’s frightening to think how unprepared we were for marriage. I don’t blame our counselor. I’m not sure he had premarital counseling either. But as I reflect back on the last 35 years, there have been a few surprises it would have been helpful to know about.
Here are six surprises I believe every pastor or premarital counselor should cover:

"Every Disciple Making Disciples, Every Church Multiplying Churches","ad4e06a7-aa75-386c-65cc-599139391e95","Jesus intends every disciple to make disciples, and he designs every local church to multiply other local churches. Yet somewhere along the way we have subtly and tragically taken the costly command of Christ to go, baptize, and teach all nations and mutated it into a comfortable call for Christians to come, be baptized, and listen in one location. The result is a rampant spectator mentality that skews discipleship across the church, stifles the spread of the church around the world, and ultimately sears the heart of what it means to be followers of Christ in local churches. This workshop explores corrective exhortations for us today based on New Testament principles and patterns for making disciples and multiplying churches.

It's so easy to see the fault in someone else or another group but so difficult to see the limitations in ourselves. Unless you learn to see the faults in yourself and your heroes, though, you can't appreciate how God has gifted other Christians. Only then can we together meet the challenges of our rapidly changing age. Maybe God has softened your heart with compassion for the broken, weak, and abused. Or he has gifted you with great courage to stand with truth. Or he has commissioned you with particular zeal and effectiveness to make disciples in all the nations. Rather than look down on and suspect the worst of one another, we are intended by God to use these diverse gifts to love the world in a church united by the gospel of Jesus Christ.

"The 3 Great Missionary Confusions","9e8e4d0b-5826-2460-2966-599148e89771","If you lived in a reasonably sized city in the United States, and you gathered 100 Protestant pastors in one room, what would they be like?
There would be significant differences. Some would see their ministerial work anchored in the gospel, others would be out of biblical orbit, and, sadly, some would be unregenerate.
The same breakdown would be true for modern-day missionaries. Vast differences would exist among them—about what they do and why they do it. Sadly, some would be unregenerate.
Confusion over modern missions is why churches must ensure their missionaries have rock-solid missiological underpinnings before they ever set foot on the field.
I’ve been involved in missions work for three decades, and I’ve found three consistent and critical missionary confusions.

Wilson gives us something of a documentary on the contemporary evangelical church, particularly those who carry the enduring scent of the church-growth movement by means of attractional ministry.

Women's ministry is not just a women’s issue; it’s a whole-church issue, and particularly a church leadership issue. We’re praying that the Lord will raise up more and more godly women teachers and leaders—Christ-exalting, gospel-centered, and Word-filled—who will be effectively deployed and supported by church leaders.

"40 Questions About Baptism and the Lord’s Supper","70fceb9d-a8c9-25f4-474d-59914bf4cddc","Just before he was arrested, in a private room in Jerusalem, Jesus of Nazareth broke bread and poured wine for his closest followers and told them, “Take, eat; this is my body” and “Drink, all of you, for this is my blood of the covenant” (Matt. 26:26–29). A few weeks later, a resurrected Jesus instructed these same disciples to go far and wide making disciples and “baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit” (Matt. 28:19). For the past 20 centuries, believers from diverse denominations with varying practices have observed these ancient and sacred rituals instituted by Christ and established by his apostles.
In 40 Questions about Baptism and the Lord’s Supper, John Hammett, senior professor of systematic theology at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary, asks and answers the most common and controversial questions about the church’s two ordinances.

"4 Ways to Make Disciples","1218c197-2db2-d4e7-1b6d-59914c77f985","Discipling doesn’t seem like the most obvious way to establish and strengthen a kingdom, does it? Kingdom building is typically the stuff of royal battles, dynastic wars, great fortunes, or works of political philosophy by old men with long gray beards.
But Jesus concluded his time on earth by commanding his disciples to make disciples. Is that really how his kingdom would be built?
Jesus taught his disciples to live in view not of today or tomorrow, but eternity. We try to help others follow Jesus; we do deliberate spiritual good; we pray for gospel influence; we proclaim God’s words, and we do all this for the sake of the Last Day. Yes, we may see some fruit now. But the goal is always to present people mature in Christ then.
What is discipling in addition to helping others follow Jesus? It’s doing them spiritual good. Specifically, it’s initiating a relationship in which you teach, correct, model, and love. Needless to say, it takes great humility.

"We Must Resurrect Church Revitalization","efa0c689-c650-1c5e-03a8-5991505cf847","The mere existence of Brian Croft’s most recent book, Biblical Church Revitalization: Solutions for Dying and Divided Churches, should encourage lovers of the gospel. Churches are being reborn as faithful Christians quietly labor to restore life and health according to God’s Word.
Still, church revitalizations are rare. Ten years ago, Thom Rainer managed to fit almost every extant case within a single volume (Breakout Churches). So-called “dying” churches appear hopeless, with few pastors initiatiating and even fewer sustaining serious efforts to see a reversal. They leave looking for greener pastures. The lion’s share of new church life seems to occur through church planting, not through committed engagement with difficult congregations.

"Church: They Excommunicated My Dad","88c7caa6-89ab-2d96-d2f5-599150f4fcaf","One Sunday after our church service, the senior pastor extended his hand to greet my dad, one of his fellow elders. Yanking his hand away, my dad jetted past him. I sometimes question why God let that instance from six years ago sear my memory. Frankly, I don’t know.
But I do know that like this memory, God used my dad’s excommunication for good. I hope this testimony shows that. I hope it encourages churches to not shirk what God requires for their good and, most importantly, for his name’s sake (see Matt. 18:15–17; 1 Cor. 5).
I suspect many pastors fear obeying Jesus’s command in this area because they dread the strife that could result. Judging by what happened with my dad and the reactions from my church, my family, and myself, I understand that fear. But I hope this testimony will help you overturn that fear and embrace faithful obedience to Jesus’s commands.

Yet church government should involve so much more. In fact, it should tie into the everyday life of the church. And everyone has a role to play. 
Did you know, ordinary church member, that Jesus has given you a job? Your elders have a special office, to be sure, but so do you. And Jesus has given you elders in order to train you to do your job. 
So if Jesus’s discipleship program gives every single member a job, what responsibilities come with this job? There are at least seven.

Last week, he thanked me for it.
Our church tries to practice formal church discipline in obedience to Scripture (Matt. 18:15–20; 1 Cor. 5:1–5; Gal. 6:1–5). Because we’re human and flawed and faulty, however, we don’t do it perfectly. But we must practice it. Our consciences are captive to the Word of God.
The only stories you ever hear about church discipline are the bad ones. That’s partly because there are lots of ways to foul it up, but also because the good stories are six years in the making. The good stories don’t make headlines. Church discipline, when rightly practiced and graced by God, “yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness” (Heb. 12:11) in those chastened by it. And when they come back to say “thank you,” it’s not a history-making moment. It’s just an another evidence of God’s redeeming grace.

The deacons generally focused on property, finances, and occasional squabbles.

The primary spiritual leaders of a congregation are the elders, who are also called overseers or pastors in the New Testament. Elders teach or preach the Word and shepherd the souls of those under their care (Eph. 4:11; 1 Tim. 3:2; 5:17; Titus 1:9; Heb. 13:17). Deacons, too, have a crucial role in the life and the health of the local church, but their role is different from the elders’. The biblical role of deacons is to take care of the physical and logistical needs of the church so that the elders can concentrate on their primary calling.

People on both sides will resist that characterization: “No, no, I talk about the local/universal, too.” But I’m referring to emphases, something measured in sermon minutes, column inches, and exclamation points.
Based on his new book, The Church: A Theological and Historical Account, Gerald Bray is inclined to the first camp. Broadsides against denominational distinctives and theological “hair-splitting” abound, especially in the book’s later prescriptive pages. For Bray, the greatest threat against the church today is disunity.
I, however, am someone whom Bray would probably characterize as one or two clicks too sectarian. And, well, I guess I’d say that one man’s hair-splitting is another man’s trim.
Yet it’s a good book, so I’m not sure how to respond other than to give you two review articles for the price of one. Bray deserves an overview, but I also want to identify the larger spectrum that distinguishes people like him and me, as well as the potential for danger on each side. Doing so, I think, will help any readers know what kind of book they are picking up with The Church, as well as for being fair to Bray and upfront about my own biases.

Almost three centuries ago, pastor-theologian Jonathan Edwards offered this observation on the value of godly leaders: “Useful men are some of the greatest blessings of a people. To have many such is more for a people’s happiness than almost anything. . . . They are precious gifts of heaven.” 
Competent shepherd-leaders are of particular worth to a congregation since their ministry is one of the primary means Christ uses to protect and provide for his people. It seems obvious, then, that those who desire to grow in their skill as shepherds and capacity to bless God’s people should make the study of biblical leadership a high priority.

"Leadership","4144f79f-6f83-7b19-0fb4-59924ed361e3","There are three things people underestimate concerning temptation. They are: human frailty; Satan’s strength; and the intercessory power Jesus’ prayers. A wrong understanding of any of these things can result in disaster. This is not only true for the average Christian, but is especially true for leaders in the church. In this message, Dr. John H. Gerstner looks at these thoughts as he discusses “Leadership.”

"Dear New Elder: 5 Encouragements as You Begin","532fb1db-f224-35b9-931b-59924f4dd8d2","Dear new elder, 
I am encouraged by the work God is doing in you and through you in calling you to serve as an elder. As the apostle Paul wrote, “Anyone who aspires to the office of elder desires a noble task” (1 Tim. 3:1).
Noble indeed, but also dangerous.
I use those phrases “in you” and “through you” intentionally, for when God raises up a man for pastoral ministry, he never leaves him in the condition he found him. He cannot. God must mold you into the right instrument to wield for building his body. God has called you, and I am certain he is fitting you for the task.
I cannot improve on Paul’s words to a young elder named Timothy in 1 Timothy 4:6–16. Based on these paragraphs and various other writings of his, I offer five lines of encouragement for you.

"Pastoral Ministry: The Pastor and Evangelism","36501e28-dff5-6c8e-b1a7-5992b0f0aa2f","A lot of times as pastors we have to admit that we are not exempt from the challenges that people in our congregations face. Some of us come from places where evangelism is illegal or so socially awkward that it feels illegal.
And we have excuses for why we don't evangelize. We need to know about ourselves that the heart that doesn't want to share the gospel will use any excuse.
Pray that God will use these sessions to inflame your heart and give you more ideas for how to be a better evangelist yourself and a model for the flock.

"Pastoral Ministry: Dangerous Calling","8d580aa7-5847-40c8-66cf-5993bce37f48","Why do so many pastors get lost in the middle of their own ministry story? What’s wrong with the way we call and relate to our pastors? What are the temptations unique to or intensified by local church ministry? Why do so many pastors live in isolation from the body of Christ? Why is so much ministry motivated by fear and not by faith? Where does our current ministry culture need to change? This study will answer these questions and more in the most honest discussion of ministry you will ever encounter. If you are a pastor, a ministry leader in your church or someone who loves and cares for your pastor, this resource is for you. Learn how the gospel can radically alter the way you think about yourself and the ministry to which God has called you.

"Pastoral Ministry: College Ministry","e5d00ec8-f68d-c989-ee1b-5993bcca6b03","Many churches struggle with how to best reach young adults between the ages of 18 and 22. Do we build another “youth group” experience for them during their college years? Do we try to push them into the life of the larger body of the local church? How do we ensure that college years foster faith in Jesus Christ that grows into maturity? We, as church leaders, need to build a biblical model of ministry to college-aged students that will prepare them for lives of gospel ministry and leadership in the church of Jesus Christ our Lord.

Almost three centuries ago, pastor-theologian Jonathan Edwards offered this observation on the value of godly leaders: “Useful men are some of the greatest blessings of a people. To have many such is more for a people’s happiness than almost anything. . . . They are precious gifts of heaven.” 
Competent shepherd-leaders are of particular worth to a congregation since their ministry is one of the primary means Christ uses to protect and provide for his people. It seems obvious, then, that those who desire to grow in their skill as shepherds and capacity to bless God’s people should make the study of biblical leadership a high priority.

"Pastoral Ministry: Keller Helps Preachers Reach the Heart","c72f46b8-0b75-acb7-8d68-599404812475","Good books on preaching the Bible abound. Books on preaching to the heart don’t. In his newest volume, Preaching: Communicating Faith in an Age of Skepticism (Viking, 2015) [20 quotes], Tim Keller aims to tackle both. “Preaching is not only explaining the text but also using it to engage the heart,” he explains. “I often see preachers giving so much time to the first task that they put little thought and ingenuity into the second.” 
The result is a much-needed volume—complete with 234 (often substantive) endnotes—that unfolds the basics of faithful preaching (exposition, illustration, application), the unique challenges—and opportunities—of our cultural moment, and the need to make Jesus the saving hero of every sermon. I don’t know of any preaching book that offers such extended insight and practical counsel on understanding the contemporary Western (late-modern) heart. More of a “manifesto than a manual,” this is a superb resource not just for preachers but for anyone desiring to faithfully and effectively convey Christian truth in a post-Christian world.
I spoke with Keller, co-founder of TGC and pastor of Redeemer Presbyterian Church in New York City, about what makes great preaching, how to capture the imagination, Jonathan Edwards the contextualizer, and more.

"Pastoral Ministry: The Pattern Among Fallen Pastors","cbff96f4-411d-9d64-5713-5994046dd534","During my time in seminary I took a leadership course taught by the late, great Howard Hendricks. As we studied the life of David, Hendricks shared a study he conducted with a group of men in full-time ministry who had fallen into a morally disqualifying sin.
At the time, I had only been a Christian for a few years, but unfortunately the subject was all too relevant. During my early days I had witnessed several men whom I loved and respected fall into serious sinful compromise. At one point in those days, the falls came so frequently I felt as if I was on the spiritual beach of Normandy watching buddies’ lives get blown apart all around me.

Though young in age, Gloria Furman displays maturity beyond her years in her new book on the role of the pastor’s wife. Her forthright honesty, as well as the wisdom she’s gleaned from God’s Word and from serving as a pastor’s wife, is both convicting and encouraging.
“We wander around like poor lost sheep, bleating that nobody loves us,” the author and blogger writes, “all the while we are actually safe forever in the arms of our Savior.”
Throughout The Pastor’s Wife: Strengthened by Grace for a Life of Love, Furman continually reminds us of the gospel and who we are in Christ. She rightly and boldly affirms that our relationship with the Shepherd and his great love for us will see pastors’ wives through the hardships of ministry with their undershepherd husbands.

"Pastoral Ministry: The Haunting of Ministry Failure","45d03953-03db-6f94-ae68-59940519c1fc","When our little church plant closed its doors after five hard years, I remember telling folks it would probably take me a while to get over it. We gave it our all. We never grew, but consistently dwindled. Outreach events reaped no fruit. My wife and I had lost many friends and were spent. I am now a statistic, I thought. I am the percentage they talk about at conferences and church planting workshops. I believe the Spirit prepared me for the church’s demise and gave great comfort as this season in our lives came to an end. However, I was already plagued by a thought that would not be easy to erase: I had failed.
Failure in ministry is generally spoken of in terms of moral failure. We read of the addictions, the affairs, the plagiarism, the misuse of money, and the spiritual abuse in leadership, and we are rightly shaken. However, there are pastors and leaders who commit no moral failure, but perceive that their ministry has failed. This is a different category altogether. What happens when you put your hand to the plow, but the visible outcome of what you do is meager or nonexistent? What does it mean when you pursue your calling, minister with all the strength Jesus supplies, preach the gospel, love people, and it just doesn’t work out? Where did it all go wrong? More precisely, you may ask, What did I do wrong? Wrestling with these questions, my own thoughts grew increasingly dark, leading to the crippling and overwhelming sense of total failure.

"Pastoral Ministry: The Church Is Not a Sanctuary: On the Ground in Charleston","45bb8339-dc1b-713f-a305-599405bd02c5","While many churches have abandoned Wednesday night prayer meetings or pastors have delegated such duties in order to focus on other areas of ministry, I love Wednesday nights. This week was no different than the Wednesdays before it. Our Charleston church gathered together. We spent 30 minutes in prayer worshiping God and making supplication for those in need. Then we settled in for our study of the book of Acts, the work of the Holy Spirit in the early church, and the power of prayer. We enjoyed a great time of teaching and fellowship, and we went home spiritually satisfied.
Fifteen miles away, another church gathered for the same purpose. Their meeting, however, didn’t end the same way. After nearly an hour in prayer, shots rang out as a visitor assassinated eight members and the beloved pastor of Emanuel AME Church. They’d gone to church to find peace in a turbulent time and they entered their eternal peace instead.

In December 1744, Jonathan Edwards preached a sermon foreshadowing his book The End for Which God Created the World, which he completed eleven years later, three years before he died. The sermon’s title is “Approaching the End of God’s Grand Design.” It is the kind of sermon that draws me back again and again to Edwards, to rescue me from the spiritual stranglehold of small things. It’s this kind of seeing that creates a seedbed of Big-God Theology and Big-God Preaching.
Reflecting on this sermon, here are three emphases that have become clearer and more central to my preaching over the years.

If you’re like me, the easiest thing to do is to take them to another pastor’s wife you respect or maybe even to someone outside the church.

Whether you’re enduring late-night counseling sessions or complaints over your husband’s preaching, she assures us Christ stands ready to help.
I corresponded with Gloria and asked her to expand on a few ways we pastors’ wives can lay down our ministry-burdens before the cross. These questions seem to always be at the top of the list for many pastors’ wives. I can assure you that both her short-form answers in this interview and her new book offer good encouragement for pastors’ wives in every season of ministry.

"Pastoral Ministry: Catching Sleep and Catching Revival","8a3d06a7-f99f-7d80-44c2-5994073ca827","The irony isn’t lost on me—I’m using the imagery of “catching sleep” to describe spiritual awakening. But I’m going for it nevertheless.
When I read the New Testament, it seems folks were either experiencing revival or longing for it. You have stories of mass conversion or prayers for God to do more than we could imagine. Longings for revival and spiritual awakening in the history of the church have produced all kinds of practices and manipulations to get the experiential fruit. But the New Testament doesn’t give us a guide for producing renewal. It doesn’t give us steps or principles. Maybe most frustratingly, it gives commands to Christians like, “Be filled with the Spirit” (Eph. 5:18), as if I’m supposed to go to my local Christian bookstore and get some. Instead, it just gives us stories and prayers. And so we pray and dream, hoping our churches can become part of the stories.

I once heard Jim Hamilton of Southern Seminary say that our conceptions of worship in heaven are sometimes distractions: “Without God and the Lamb, heaven is nothing more than a gold-plated hell.” Yes and amen. His point is that Christians often think more about what is in heaven rather than who is in heaven. The same thing happens when present-day churches gather as well. Churches are sometimes hampered in their worship by petty arguments about styles, colors, choirs, and the like, all the while losing sight of the object of their worship—the Lord Jesus Christ. Churches sorely need to refocus their services around the central object of their worship.
In a new book, Gather God’s People: Understand, Plan, and Lead Worship in Your Local Church, Brian Croft and Jason Adkins offer a way forward—a way in which worship services can be biblical, engaging, and Christ-centered. God cares about how he is worshiped, and not everyone worships rightly. Thus, Croft and Adkins write to help pastors organize worship services that limit distractions and fail to focus on what Scripture prescribes: the greatness of God, the sinful plight of humanity, and our need for Christ.

"Pastoral Ministry: Same-Sex Marriage Will Affect the Pews Before the Pulpit","e2a058bd-e233-14f0-3cb3-5994e8d3740f","The Supreme Court has asserted that the U. S. Constitution mandates all 50 states to license civil “marriages” between same-sex couples. You are a pastor who believes that God ordained marriage to be exclusively the union of one man and one woman. You know research shows that, on average, husbands and wives—and children raised by a married mother and father—are happier, healthier, and more prosperous than people in other living situations. 
What should you do now?
In the immediate term, the answer is “nothing different.” If you believe God ordained marriage to be the union of one man and one woman, you should continue to perform or host in your church only weddings that include both a bride and a groom.
The Supreme Court’s decision does not bind churches or clergy. It is about the licensing of civil marriages by the state. Religious weddings performed by religious institutions or leaders are an (almost) entirely separate question.

"Pastoral Ministry: The Church Is a Leadership Factory","a48ed0ad-33ea-2e73-9b99-5994e897d3c5","The church ought to see itself as a leadership factory that stirs up the gifts of God in people, not an auditorium that gathers people behind a leader. Jesus did not build his church by recruiting the 12 brightest from the rabbi’s list of “up and coming stars” and platforming them in large stadiums around the world. His disciples were mostly blue-collar workers with little to no formal theological training.
Yet through his Spirit, Jesus uses this ragtag group of misfits to turn the world upside down. Peter, the disciple with a foot-shaped mouth who wilted before a teenage girl, became the church’s most courageous leader and premiere preacher (John 18:15–18). When Jesus chose Peter, he was not a star. He was a man in desperate need of development. Jesus made him into a star.
If developing leaders is what Jesus got most excited about in the church, isn’t that what we should be most excited about, too? Let me suggest four important implications for how we should approach ministry.

"Pastoral Ministry: Gaining by Losing: Why the Future Belongs to Churches that Send","1719146b-515c-493c-8f3a-5994ee032ae4","People who have been shuffled around from church to church make up most large churches today. They come together to hear well-polished sermons and expect a missions pastor or some other church leader to organize outreaches that accomplish the Great Commission. As J. D. Greear points out, “90 percent of evangelicals have never shared their faith with anyone outside their family. . . . 95 percent of the church growth we celebrate merely shuffles existing Christians around.”
The church is shrinking in the West. Pastors can no longer assume people will visit their church because they have impressive facilities and family ministries. Therefore, members need to be trained and pastors need to begin seeing themselves as leaders called to develop leaders. The primary purpose for leaders in the church, after all, is to “equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ” (Eph. 4:12).
In Gaining By Losing: Why the Future Belongs to Churches that Send, Greear tells us how his church shifted focus from growing in numbers of attenders to training and sending disciples to make other disciples. Multiplication beats addition every time.
Greear, pastor of The Summit Church in Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina, separates Gaining By Losing into two parts. The first unpacks the book’s thesis: that churches need to shift their focus from building up their own kingdom to building leaders who will be sent out to build up God’s kingdom. The second part unpacks what Greear calls the “10 sending plumb lines,” which are the directional markers for all ministries at his church. Two appendices outlining his church’s international and domestic church planting strategies follow this.

"Pastoral Ministry: The Preacher’s Neglected Tool","c71e30d2-181e-c937-1e7b-5994f3eba81f","How does a preacher “know nothing but Christ crucified” (1 Cor. 2:2) when preaching through Leviticus or Lamentations? What does it mean to be “gospel-centered” when you’re leading a Bible study on the locusts of Joel, or the false teachers of Jude?
We all want to be Christ-centered in our teaching and preaching. But it’s not always obvious how each particular text of Scripture gets us to Christ. One of the most helpful tools for connecting the dots—and simultaneously one of the most neglected—is biblical theology, which (in evangelical circles) refers to the art of reading thematically across the entire Bible as one story. 
To learn more about biblical theology, and its relevance for expository preaching, I corresponded with Graeme Goldsworthy, former lecturer at Moore Theological College in Sydney, Australia, and author of numerous helpful books on biblical theology, including Preaching the Whole Bible as Christian Scripture: The Application of Biblical Theology to Expository Preaching (Eerdmans, 2000) and Christ-Centered Biblical Theology: Hermeneutical Foundations and Principles (IVP Academic, 2012).

"Pastoral Ministry: The Pastor and Counseling: The Basics of Shepherding Members in Need","ae710984-d7a4-8aac-1ef9-5994f7a21786","After being in pastoral ministry for nearly 16 years, I’ve never found a way to shepherd without engaging in personal conversations with sufferers and sinners who need God’s grace. Even more, I’ve never found a way to avoid being one of those troubled people. If there’s a device that can separate pastoral ministry from the inevitability of conflict, affliction, hard listening, and weighty conversation, then it remains undiscovered. 
Jeremy Pierre (professor of biblical counseling at Southern Seminary in Louisville) and Deepak Reju (pastor of biblical counseling and family ministry at Capitol Hill Baptist Church in Washington, DC) have partnered to write a primer for those who wish to move beyond lecturing or avoiding to personally ministering God’s Word. The Pastor and Counseling: The Basics of Shepherding Members in Need [audio interview] offers a clear and concrete approach to counseling informed by Scripture and introduces pastors to the labor of constructive ministry conversation.

"Pastoral Ministry: 5 Strategies for Raising Pastor’s Kids to Love the Church","b98b41f2-d156-a44c-980f-5994f78f958e","It was a typical Sunday morning in the church foyer. My older son was hiding behind my dress as strangers tried to compliment him. My younger son ran up to a kind older lady and kicked her in the shin. My infant daughter, strapped onto my chest with a stretchy baby wrap, spit up on the inside of the baby wrap. I froze while curdled milk dripped down the front of me.
Ladies and gentlemen, the pastor’s family has arrived!
The truth is pastors’ kids are just regular kids. They give grief. They sin. They must be taught to treasure God and love his Word. They do, however, have unique pressure placed on them that often leads them to begrudge the church. As parents, then, we should put strategies in place to help our children love the church rather than resent it.

I am a theologian who also happens to be a pastor, and a pastor who also shepherds minds. Following Michael Kruger’s taxonomy, I am a “scholar-pastor,” someone who works full-time in the academy and part-time in the pastorate. My days are spent behind a lectern; my weekends behind a pulpit.

"Pastoral Ministry: Are You a Proficiently Reliant Pastor?","68e67b6b-1488-b439-44e5-5994fb9a3e50","I graduated from seminary and was looking to pastor when a church invited me to candidate. They asked me to preach a couple of times, and a week later inquired whether I would be their pastor. Unfortunately, the previous pastor had introduced theological errors into the life of the church, and it was embroiled in theological heterodoxy. The congregation and elders were still trying to decide where they stood on these vital issues. To make matters more difficult, this church was at odds with its denomination’s teaching. 
I wasn’t sure what to do. I wanted to pastor a church, and here was a local body of believers who wanted me as their pastor. But it was a church brimming with problems. By God’s grace, an older pastor in the faith gave me some helpful advice: “Jason, don’t get entangled in controversies early in ministry. Devote your first years to learning the Scriptures above all else.” This was good and godly counsel.
I took his advice and told the church I wouldn’t become their senior pastor. I made one of the best decisions of my life.

"Pastoral Ministry: Shepherding with Sense and Sensibility","a4f05762-4de2-ba8e-9195-5994fdd9eb96","Most of us have been trained in seminary to pastor with good sense. As pastors, we’re called to rightly divide the word of truth (2 Tim. 2:15). Sound doctrinal preaching and teaching is a mark of faithful biblical ministry (Titus 2:1). In other words, we labor to present the truth of God with clarity and soundness. But we cannot leave it at that.
While we’re called to pastor with sense, we should also pastor our people with sensibility. The more I spend time with people in the church, the more I agree with James K. A. Smith: people are as deeply moved emotionally as they are intellectually (see Desiring The Kingdom). Therefore, we need to lead the affective or emotional disposition of our people if we want to holistically shape them. I’m not advocating for emotional manipulation, but a more thorough spiritual formation.

"Pastoral Ministry: 5 Ways to Deepen Your Preaching","dee64a14-5e21-4757-2a2c-5994fd9bf3ac","I’ve been blessed lately with the opportunity to preach a bit more. I love preaching, and I got excellent homiletics training at Covenant Seminary. But the more I learn about preaching, the more I realize how much more there still is to learn. For me, preaching is like a vast mountain, the top of which is hidden by clouds; and the higher I climb, the more it stretches up still higher above me.
I think every preacher who has some awareness of the grandness and height of his task knows this feeling. I’ve referenced before the statement by Martyn Lloyd-Jones that “any man who has had some glimpse of what it is to preach will inevitably feel that he has never preached.” To that could be added the testimony of Charles Spurgeon: “There is no good preacher who is not moved almost to the point of tears at the end of every sermon at how poor was the message he just delivered.”
And yet, Sunday by Sunday, we preach. And a little regular practice goes a long way to helping you get a sense of what works and what doesn’t. If you are a fellow preacher, trying to climb this vast and steep mountain alongside me, I hope these five reflections about what I’m learning might be helpful to you.

It therefore stands to reason, Andrew Purves notes, that “pastors must ever grow in their knowledge and understanding of people.” The best way to know people is to live among them, to share their sorrows, joys, challenges, and frustrations.
But people come in many shapes and sizes, and there’s not enough time to become acquainted with everyone you meet. Hence the importance of becoming acquainted with literature, the laboratory of the human condition.

In churches today, however, not enough preaching is expositional in nature. Worldwide, 75 percent of Christians are being taught by preachers with little or no training.
Jesús is 37-year-old Presbyterian pastor in La Ceiba, Honduras, a city with a population of about 120,000. 
Seventy-five percent are Roman Catholic, and most “evangelicals” have succumbed to prosperity teaching or false doctrine. His church has 50 faithful members.
Jesús tirelessly shepherds his flock, but like 85 percent of pastors in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, he has no seminary training 
(and just six years of primary school). He is bi-vocational, pastoring the church and running an ice cream business to pay the bills and provide for his wife and two kids.
In the cool Honduran mornings, Jesús counsels families and visits the sick. In the evenings, he leads small groups. To prepare to preach on Sundays, he reads his Bible, consults the four books he owns, and takes Saturday walks to the library to read and watch videos on TGC’s Spanish website. He recently e-mailed us (in Spanish): “I am in great need of training to rightly handle the Word of God in my preaching. Can you help?”

"Pastoral Ministry: Shaping Shepherds for Costly Grace","94d60696-2d11-3667-0435-5995017ae26c","Dietrich Bonhoeffer’s The Cost of Discipleship expresses what sort of students and faculty should constitute seminaries that are communities of costly grace emphasizing God’s grace, God’s call, and God’s standards for shepherds. Life Together describes what Bonhoeffer wanted these communities of Christ’s body to do together and explains why he wanted them to do it.
Bonhoeffer was not out to establish a new brand of Protestant monasticism in Germany. The means mattered to him, and he kept students practicing them, but he linked these means to the end result, which mattered most. He was trying to shape shepherds for local church communities of costly grace. Such pastors needed to understand how to preach, pray, read God’s Word, serve God’s people, and live in family-type community with other believers. He believed seminaries that form such persons are special visible ministries of the body of Christ.
Bonhoeffer thought these communities should strive to reach at least three goals.

It’s a passive activity, something preached to me, not something I actively do.
Ah, but it’s not. After the parable of the sower, Jesus says: “Consider carefully how you listen” (Luke 8:18). He says if we listen in one way, we will be given more, but if we listen in another way, even what we think we have will be taken from us. It’s a life-and-death business, listening to sermons. So let us consider carefully how to listen. Here are seven pointers.

"Pastoral Ministry: Become an Iceberg Pastor","e5ec6e0c-ae00-917a-17f5-59950313431d","When you’re a pastor, from time to time people will ask you, “What do you do during the week?” It’s an excellent question (but not usually for the reasons people ask it).
There are no job descriptions for pastoral ministry in the New Testament. Yes, there are directives and pointers that feed into the picture of what pastoral work looks like. But, generally speaking, I’d say that how a pastor spends his time is usually more influenced by a whole range of other factors—personality, church culture, theological heritage, character, and context.
For me, it’s a matter of constant adjustments and course corrections. I doubt I shall ever be satisfied that I can confidently tell you what a pastor should do during the week, and that’s partly because there simply cannot be a universal job description for this calling.

"Pastoral Ministry: There Is No Such Thing as a Prosperity Pastor","49f7ab6e-1712-335c-c742-5995049ca595","While ministering in the United Arab Emirates I’ve noticed a higher than usual concentration of “prosperity theology” among those who call themselves Christians. I have theorized about why. Perhaps it’s because most who come here for work arrive with the hope of prosperity; therefore, prosperity theology offers some kind of hope that with God’s favor their dreams will be realized. People sacrifice greatly, leaving children and spouses behind in places like Kenya and the Philippines with the hope of securing a financially prosperous future. 
But so often life here fails to meet the expectations of those who come for wealth, as does the prosperity teaching in which so many put their hope. Life is hard, suffering is real, and riches are elusive. So pastorally speaking, what does prosperity theology have to offer when life doesn’t work out? How do “pastors” of prosperity churches shepherd their people when prosperity is nowhere to be found?
The answer I’m discovering is that they don’t.

"Pastoral Ministry: Are You Called to a Ministry of Rejection?","31975531-56f4-cc91-c7a2-5995055ae029","In Isaiah 6, in one of the most stunning pictures of the pre-incarnate Christ recorded in the Old Testament, the prophet Isaiah experiences a vision of the Lord sitting on his throne. When he lays eyes on the Lord, the prophet cries out: 
Woe is me! For I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts! (Isa. 6:5)
Isaiah is so distraught that he curses himself—he knows no one can see the Lord and live (Exod. 33:20). But he doesn’t die; instead, an angel takes a piece of coal from the altar and cleanses him, touching it to his lips. His guilt is taken away, his sin atoned for (Isa. 6:7).
Then the Lord speaks: “Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?” Isaiah replies, “Here I am! Send me” (Isa. 6:8).
Almost every time this story is examined, this is where it stops. Isaiah’s bold answer to the Lord’s call is inspirational. It tends to be declared in heroic fashion, as though he’s saying, “Don’t worry, Lord; I got this!”
This is how so many of us treat this passage. We act as though it’s a call to embrace our “moment” and do great things for God, to move mountains and make the sun stand still.

"Pastoral Ministry: 5 Reasons to Keep Politicians Out of Your Pulpit","47c144e8-920b-aa0f-455b-59950599cd75","Like a whirlwind, he and his entourage blow in 45 minutes late for service. After the pastor hands him the mic, he makes his political pitch—peppered with religious clichés and out-of-context verses. Of course, he’s far too modest to ask for your vote directly; he only asks for your prayers. And just as quickly as he arrived, he’s gone (there are still other churches to “hit up”), leaving a trail of brochures and campaign slogans in his wake.
As local and national campaign cycles ramp up, many churches will again consider whether to allow politicians in their Sunday morning pulpits. For some congregations, this question isn’t up for debate. They feel certain political figures promote the moral and social interests of the kingdom of God; therefore, they’re happy to have these “culture warriors” tell them exactly how to promote the kingdom through legislation.
Here are five common reasons churches choose to hear political candidates from the “sacred desk,” and why I believe each fails the sniff test.

"Pastoral Ministry: How to Spot a False Teacher","eef1a7c6-d840-61f9-69ff-599505a42549","False teachers come in all shapes and sizes, ranging from the most deranged cult leader to the most winsome television preacher. Too many professing Christians are duped into embracing heretical ideas or endorsing spiritually dangerous movements. Some of these movements even pass themselves off as evangelical.
If you’re a pastor, chances are at least a few of your church members have flirted with false teaching at some point in their spiritual journeys.
Of course, false teachers aren’t a recent phenomenon; they’ve been trying to undermine the gospel and corrupt God’s people since the earliest days of the church. Titus 1 shows us that Paul’s protégé, Titus, had to deal with the threat of false teachers among the Cretan Christians in the middle of the first century.

"Pastoral Ministry: Why Are Pastors Leaving Churches So They Can Pastor?","19356a19-40e7-3ed0-5625-599506be9177","By objective measures Russ Ramsey excelled as a pastor. As the preaching pastor of a Nashville church, he had seen the congregation grow from one to three services in five years. Attendance jumped from 180 to about 700. And Ramsey loved the challenge. The church was situated in one of Nashville’s trendiest neighborhoods. Students from nearby Vanderbilt University mingled with urban creatives for weekly worship in a 1908 white brick steepled church. You couldn’t assume voting patterns. You couldn’t assume spiritual maturity. You couldn’t even assume the most basic beliefs. Opportunities for evangelism and discipleship abounded.
So it came as a shock to much of the congregation when late last year Ramsey announced his resignation. But the reason was the bigger surprise. He wasn’t leaving because he already had another ministry job lined up. He wasn’t leaving because he was burned out. He wasn’t leaving because of conflict within the congregation. He was leaving because he wanted to be a pastor. So he could preach and teach and write and counsel. His calling hadn’t changed. But the needs of his church had.
A growing congregation is the kind of problem every pastor wants. Not many pastors overall see much if any numeric increase in membership during their tenures, let alone the kind Ramsey saw in Nashville. But growth brings its own challenges. And many pastors who thrive in a church’s dynamic growth stage struggle to manage increasingly complex structures and leadership burdens when their congregations demand them.

"Pastoral Ministry: 3 Truths to Fight Pastoral Despair","e2c4f3be-247e-487d-e221-5995067eadbd","In my early years as a pastor I met many men who seemed hardened and jaded by their decades in ministry. They recited laundry lists of offenses that deacons and church members had committed against them through the years. They seemed to have little confidence God was at work in their current ministries. This seemed odd to me. I couldn’t fathom how they weren’t daily blown away by the immense privilege of pastoring God’s people.
Few years had to pass before I started feeling some of the same things. John Stott’s observation began to ring clearly: “Discouragement is the occupational hazard of Christian ministry.”
Pastors preach the gospel every week. We stand behind the pulpit, look across the room, and proclaim the free pardon of sin found in Christ alone. We remind people of the hope they have in Christ when they walk through life’s darkest valleys—then we wrestle with crippling despair ourselves as we forget the very gospel we preach to others.

Most of us don’t relish the idea of delighting our parishioners with details of cleansing skin diseases. 
But I’ve recently been learning how mistaken we are when we take this approach to Leviticus.

"Pastoral Ministry: How to Preach to Both Head and Heart","13c4e76b-fabe-24cc-3345-59950ed25fbc","Expository preaching seems to be on the rise among younger evangelicals, but its recovery raises numerous questions. Is verse-by-verse exposition valid for every type of church? Does it appeal to more intellectual audiences than to more emotional ones? And what exactly is “expository preaching” anyway? 
Robert Smith has been working through these issues as both a teacher and a practitioner of preaching for the past several decades. He serves as Baptist chair of divinity at Beeson Divinity School in Birmingham, Alabama, where he teaches preaching. Previously he served as preaching professor at Southern Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky, and for 20 years pastored New Mission Missionary Baptist Church in Cincinnati, Ohio.

"Pastoral Ministry: TGC Asks: 3 Books Every Church Planter Should Read","8eeb4a06-d992-977d-7c8f-59950f4c5bd2","Church planting is hard. Ever since the Book of Acts, it has stretched and exhilarated and exhausted those called to the work.
But church planting is also essential. If the gospel is going to spread, which it will (Matt. 16:18), then multiplying churches is vital to the mission (Matt. 28:18–20).
Every planter needs books—companions and guides for the journey. Whether thinking through philosophy of ministry or structures of polity or specifics of strategy, good literature can cast vision, steel resolve, and replenish empty tanks. But with so many books clamoring for your attention as a planter, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed. It’s not like you have much spare time.
What, then, should you pick up? I asked 20 pastors what three books every planter should read and why.

I’m keenly aware there are many strong opinions on each version of the marriage question, and lively disagreements about which couples evangelical pastors should marry. And with last year’s Supreme Court decision on same-sex marriage, the debate of course does not end there.

In the past, God had called us to take what I’d considered big leaps of faith by asking us to go places and do things I never felt comfortable with. But this was different. This was radical. I kept asking myself, How do two people from coastal northern California and the nation’s capitol end up in Arkansas? The answer: God does it. That’s how.
As my husband, Brad, wrestled with the Lord through the decision to uproot our lives from the church and the ministry life that began there 15 years earlier, I waited. I said little. I knew this decision was huge.
This was unusual for me, as I’m prone to speak my opinion rather freely. Brad encourages it, in fact. But this time was different. He needed to wrestle without me. I needed to let God work without my words butting in.
Then it happened. Brad knew God was taking us to “Hog Nation.” He made the decision, and we began frantically packing up our home and lives, saying some painful “see you laters,” and preparing to transplant ourselves in four weeks.

“We need to visit the house of every family in our city at least once a year!” . . . “Ohhh-kay. So who gave you a copy of The Reformed Pastor?”
“We should all cancel our summer vacations and spend a week doing ministry in the slums!” . . . “Hmm. So you finally got around to reading Radical, huh?”
“How come we’re not planting more churches? A new church is eight times more effective in evangelism than an established church!” . . . “Oh yeah, you just got back from the Exponential conference, didn’t you?”

"Pastoral Ministry: What Should I Preach Next?","85bb058d-b284-ec76-f960-59952d6cf706","Part of the process of preparing to preach expository sermons is selecting your text. While this may sound self-evident, there are important factors to consider when selecting a passage to preach, not the least of which is discerning the spiritual state and needs of your unique congregation.
For many preachers, however, choosing a text occurs on the Monday or Tuesday prior to the upcoming Sunday. This is not helpful or wise. You won’t have the time you’d like and need for important factors such as studying the text and context, meditating on its truths for you and your hearers, finding compelling illustrations, and identifying meaningful applications. 
Further, the last thing you need is to be stressed out because you’re not sure the text you’ve chosen is the right one at the right time. To offset this tendency and temptation, I offer two assumptions about preaching followed by three suggestions about selecting a text to preach.

"Pastoral Ministry: The Sheep Aren’t Stupid","aff2f91a-79f3-2d1b-82a0-59952e01b647","Pastors sometimes say stupid things. Sometimes those stupid things are catchy and wind up being repeated by many other pastors. One of the more preposterous statements I’ve heard many preachers say is, “Sheep are dumb.” They say this as shepherds in reference to the sheep of the church—the congregation. The idea is that sheep are dumb, and must be led well. We shouldn’t be surprised when they do stupid things.
My problem with this statement is that it disrespects people made in God’s image and redeemed by God’s Son. Its mocks the church and exalts the self. The church isn’t stupid. Sinful, yes. Stupid, no. Speaking of the church in this way will get a chuckle from some leaders (who aren’t already bored by the worn-out expression), but will create distance between leadership and the people pastors are called to lead.
The sheep aren’t dumb. In fact, we would do much better if we thought of the sheep the way the Puritan Thomas Watson (1620–1686) described them in his sermon, “The Good Shepherd.”

Churches are being reborn as faithful Christians quietly labor to restore life and health according to God’s Word.
Still, church revitalizations are rare. Ten years ago, Thom Rainer managed to fit almost every extant case within a single volume (Breakout Churches). So-called “dying” churches appear hopeless, with few pastors initiatiating and even fewer sustaining serious efforts to see a reversal. They leave looking for greener pastures. The lion’s share of new church life seems to occur through church planting, not through committed engagement with difficult congregations.

"Pastoral Ministry: Tragic Times Demand Timely Texts","119f4dca-6932-9272-063a-599531a7222d","Preaching through books of the Bible is my jam. I love to take months and work through a book, as I did recently in Hebrews over the course of 44 sermons. I am convinced and see persistent evidence that the best way Christians learn the Word of God is through the systematic and regular study of its books. Only careful exposition that builds line upon line, precept upon precept, truth upon truth, will give those in my care a strategic grasp of biblical truth over a span of years.
Since the Bible has 66 books and two testaments but I only have one life to preach it, I may change the lens from one book to another so that I’m looking more or less closely at its treasures. While I have to decide whether to take months or weeks in any one book, my standard method of preaching and teaching is systematic exposition.
But I am a shepherd who preaches, not a preacher who shepherds. In other words, I am not merely a Bible teacher exegeting the text, but a pastor walking through life with the people I serve and applying the texts I exegete. Every so often a life event occurs that requires—even demands—that I deviate from my schedule, that I park the plan for a while to preach to a specific need that occupies the minds and troubles the hearts of my people.
To ignore it would be spiritual malpractice.
A doctor might have a patient on a healthy diet and particular pharmaceutical regimen for a heart issue, but if a kidney stone suddenly lodges somewhere in the patient, the doctor has to treat that. Pastors, too, must keep their eyes on the acute as well as the chronic.

"Pastoral Ministry: Don’t Let Non-Christians Write Your Liturgy","a56958d9-5d86-e71c-baf4-59953203c90c","When I was a young pastor, I was eager to find and replicate worthy ministry models. I was attracted to the church growth movement. I admired the soul-winning zeal of practioners who counseled young pastors like me to fashion their Sunday services so the “seeker” wouldn’t trip over man-made obstacles on his way to finding Jesus.
While I absorbed many of its lessons—clear communication, ministry excellence, community outreach—I began to have some questions about an approach that shapes the Sunday gathering exclusively around the unbeliever. I say “exclusively” because every pastor should have, in his mind, the image of a lost soul when he steps up to the pulpit to preach. He shouldn’t assume his audience is entirely made up of believers, and his preaching should be clear enough so the lost know how to repent and believe. Paul counseled Timothy to “do the work of an evangelist,” after all (2 Tim. 2:5).
There are, however, three vital questions to ask ourselves about our worship services.

"Pastoral Ministry: 5 Things Not to Trust in Your Preaching","c99e4182-4fbb-b311-e320-59953232ac34","I’m not certain the average Christian recognizes how many pitfalls there are in preaching. Of course, you don’t need any special training to recognize when a preacher is truly struggling with a sermon. We can feel that. And anyone with even a little Christian experience is aware that pride can be a temptation to the preacher. In fact, the apostle Paul took special note of pride and Satan’s snares when listing qualifications for pastors (1 Tim. 3:6).
But there are other less obvious challenges to the preacher’s life. Take, for example, trust. I suspect most preachers regularly fight to put their trust in the correct place when it comes to their preaching. Maybe that’s just me, but I’m probably not alone. It seems to me it’s easy for the preacher to trust himself even when he doesn’t intend to.

"Pastoral Ministry: 3 Ways to Respond When Slandered","5e27351a-40b0-d504-4eb5-599533e67dbd","Slander is a serious sin. Like its cousin gossip, slander is incredibly destructive. It “lies in wait for blood” (Prov. 12:6), “destroys neighbors” (Prov. 11:9), and “separates close friends” (Prov. 16:28). But while both gossip and slander involve destructive speech, slander adds the additional element of dishonesty.
Gossip spreads the fire, but slander sparks it.
It’s acutely painful to be slandered, and pastors and ministry leaders are particularly easy targets. Precisely because it’s such a serious sin, we must be especially careful to guard our hearts when it happens to us. One of the easiest ways to be led into sin is when we’re sinned against.

One biographer concluded the success of Brooks’s ministry was due to the faithfulness of his wife. I know many pastors, including myself, who would say the same thing.
Elders’ wives are the unsung heroes of the local church.
Husbands depend on their prayers, and congregations depend on their labor. They may teach children, lead women’s ministries, organize neighborhood Bible studies, practice hospitality, write books, or counsel the downhearted. Their ministries differ depending on their desires, their gifts, and the church’s needs. But they all support a man who has been called to shepherd a local church.
Having served on the elder body of three different congregations, I know firsthand the temptations elders face, but I’ve also seen how the wives of elders can struggle.

Then comes the bar exam, and if you manage to pass, you might get an entry-level job at a law firm.

This is how almost all careers work. To get the necessary skills, you start at the bottom, doing grunt work, and then slowly claw your way to the top, maybe muddying a couple of middle managers as you go.
Pastoral ministry isn’t like most careers.
The call to ministry isn’t necessarily revealed by the degree or skill set you possess, although those things certainly play some part in ministry. Ironically, the call to ministry emerges as you diligently apply yourself to something every other Christian is called to as well: service in your local church.

The Background: According to a recent Pew Research survey, the number of Americans who say churches contribute “some” or a “great deal” to solving important social problems has declined substantially over the past eight years.
While three-quarters of Americans (75 percent) responded “some/great deal” in 2008, fewer than one in five (19 percent) now say churches contribute a “great deal,” and fewer than four in ten (38 percent) say they contribute “some.”
Almost four in ten (39 percent) say religious institutions make little to no contribution in this area, a 16-point increase since 2008.
People with no religious affiliation (atheists, agnostics, and those who say their religion is “nothing in particular”) are less likely than others to see churches as key problem-solvers in society, Pew notes. While white evangelicals remain among the most convinced that churches help solve social problems, even they have become less inclined to express this view today than in the recent past (70 percent today as opposed to 86 percent in 2008).

"Pastoral Ministry: 3 Dangers of Preaching in a Digital Age","cfa20833-09da-7423-3294-59953cbead59","Our relationship with culture is one of reciprocity, of mutual formation. The artifacts, technologies, and webs of meaning we make open new opportunities, normalize new expectations, and give birth to new pressures. We’re largely unaware of these pressures, but they’re powerfully formative. We create culture, and culture, in turn, creates us.
As a narrow illustration, consider the effect of email on our work. We can communicate instantaneously from any location in a way that promotes efficiency and coordination (opportunities). This ability raises the bar of what we feel we ought to accomplish, reinforces our individual sense of control over our lives, and introduces new codes of etiquette (expectations). But there are pressures, too: the obligation to respond immediately, the guilt of being unreachable, the feelings of powerlessness and isolation when we’re disconnected, the lingering sense that we’re never really away from our work. It’s not so simple, after all.
An integral part of ministry involves helping Christians recognize how our culture is forming us so we can intentionally pursue gospel-shaped formation in our cultural moment. Pastors must ask, “How can I help the church discern the forces of our culture?” We also must ask, “How do the forces of our culture shape the way I minister?”

"Pastoral Ministry: Preacher’s Toolkit: How Long Should It Take Me to Prepare a Sermon?","4b1d7bd1-6fb6-b4df-d7de-59953d15f6bd","This is an easier question to ask than answer. It’s tempting to reply with the time-honored standard of “15 hours” and move merrily on our way. But sermon preparation, expository or otherwise, defies simple calculations. It blends both science and art, and is ignited by the exhilaratingly unpredictable combustion of God’s active presence.
It’s like the lad who asks the seasoned fisherman, “How long does it take to catch a fish each week?” The experienced angler pauses, knowing the question defies an easy answer because every cast contains elements entirely beyond his control. Fishing may be his weekly routine, but there is nothing routine about catching fish.
Preaching prep is no different. The time allotted to develop sermons becomes a blending of proficiency and providence, of work and wonder; we must live in the tension between our well-ordered rhythms and variables not entirely controllable.

"Pastoral Ministry: Should You Pastor a Church You Would Never Attend?","b5d13baf-8a7d-e12e-e9cd-59953d437120","Questions about God’s will in accepting a pastoral call can dog pastors. Andrew Fuller, a noted 18th-century British pastor and theologian, spent three years struggling over whether to leave his pastorate in Soham to accept a call to Kettering. The decision to move led to one of that generation’s most memorable pastorates.
But not all turn out that way. Some moves leave pastors wondering if staying put would have proved better.
When considering a pastoral call, one often takes a sobering look at the new church: Do they believe the gospel? Will they appreciate expository preaching? Do they want biblical leadership? Are they interested in spiritual growth? Do they have a heart for discipleship? Will they adequately support my family?
Unfortunately, each of these questions won’t always be answered clearly before accepting a call. Rarely do initial visits and discussions give the full picture. In such cases, the newly installed pastor may face some rude awakenings. He may wonder if he’d even attend the church if they weren’t writing his paycheck.

"Pastoral Ministry: Pastor, Confess Your Sin—No Matter the Consequences","87782525-e0e9-6c77-7ffd-59953d71ec96","Pastors are flawed, sinful people, just like the rest of us. But those called to vocational ministry are and should be held to a high standard of personal holiness. Paul told Timothy that elders must be “above reproach” (1 Tim. 3:2). James warns, “Not many of you should become teachers . . . because you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness” (3:1).
This standard presents a difficult situation for pastors in dealing with their own temptations and sin. If they try to conceal their sin, they imperil their souls. If they confess their sin, they risk losing their jobs—even if what they confess doesn’t disqualify them from ministry according to Scripture. Healthy spirituality is only possible when sin can be openly confessed, but this is a tricky thing for pastors to do well.
To talk about these difficult questions, I’m joined on this podcast by Ray Ortlund. He is lead pastor of Immanuel Nashville, president of Renewal Ministries, regional director for Acts 29, and a TGC Council member.

"Pastoral Ministry: How Has Your Preaching Changed Over the Years?","19ad3426-0243-353c-3a28-59953eec7de4","For expositors of God’s Word, revisiting early sermons can be an excruciating and embarrassing exercise. Thankfully, pastors H. B. Charles, Bryan Chapell, and Ray Ortlund were up to the task. In this eight-minute roundtable, these three veteran pastors reflect on the ways God has matured their preaching over their many years in ministry.
Charles (pastor of Shiloh Metropolitan Baptist Church in Jacksonville, Florida) pinpoints two areas in particular that transformed his preaching: growth in his understanding of the gospel and spiritual maturity in his own personal walk with the Lord. 
Chapell (senior pastor of Grace Presbyterian Church in Peoria, Illinois, and TGC Council member) remembers his early days of only preaching what he calls “systematic lectures” and “practical instruction,” that is, until the writings of Sidney Greidanus changed his understanding of Scripture.
Ortlund (senior pastor of Immanuel Church in Nashville, Tennessee and TGC Council member) talks about his years of preaching clunky academic sermons that did little to apply God’s Word to his congregation. Though diligent in studying the text, he struggled to translate it in such a way that would help people.
While all three have grown in various ways as preachers, watch (or listen) to hear each of these men testify to God’s mercy to them as ministers of the gospel.

"Pastoral Ministry: A Simple Way to Pray for a Small Congregation","645406cc-fc92-d2f1-e58c-59953e25a127","I have the great joy of being a small church pastor. Because it is small, I know everyone, and because I know everyone, I can pray specifically for them by name.
As a pastor I consider it a privilege as well as a responsibility to pray daily for those in my congregation. But I confess it is easy to resort to token prayers. You know the ones: “Lord, be with Jim today—and Andrew and Janet.” 
The dailyness of prayer—the dailyness of anything—can suck the life and thought out of a task, even one like going before the throne of the living God for the people he has given me to love. 
But prayer is not just one of many responsibilities—it is a primary one. I have wrestled with this privileged responsibility since the good people at Christ Community Church allowed me to come among them. While my ever-present goal is to pray for them each day, the method by which I seek to accomplish this has varied.
I want to share how I attempt (sometimes better than others) to keep rote prayers at bay. And my prayer as I write this is that you, whether pastor or church member, may be encouraged to pray for the people you fellowship with on a weekly basis.

"Pastoral Ministry: Let an Actual Shepherd Teach You to Pastor","18d4f7ec-7186-ff0f-e771-59953f7a807c","When I was a boy in the 1960s and ’70s I sometimes rode to church with my paternal grandparents. My grandfather, born in 1901, was a stockman trained by his maternal grandfather. He raised cattle, pigs, and sheep in Southwest Missouri. Even then, small farms and diversification were becoming rare. My grandfather was among the last of the local shepherds. By the time he had to quit, the closest sheep market was four hours away. 
Once when we were on the way home after a sermon on Jesus as shepherd, I asked my grandfather for an assessment. He replied, “Our pastor is a good man. But he knows little about sheep.” Surely he could have added, “Or shepherds.”
Hopefully, most ministers know the word “pastor” basically means “shepherd.” They will have keen interest, then, in learning more about their vocation’s governing metaphor so they can grow into it. They will need to know more about sheep, shepherding, and land in ancient and modern times. So they could well use a shepherd’s guidance.

"Pastoral Ministry: Keller, Piper, and Carson on When Your Pastor Fails Morally","c5197bd1-7bf8-0bee-46d3-59953fcfb834","In this new five-minute roundtable, Tim Keller, John Piper, and Don Carson answer a hard and sobering question: What would you say to a congregation that has lost its pastor due to moral failure?
For Keller (TGC vice president and pastor of Redeemer Presbyterian Church in Manhattan), a good starting point is encouraging congregations not to become disillusioned about leadership or institutions. Instead, they should first look to the fallen nature we all share as human beings. Carson (TGC president and research professor of New Testament at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School) reminds us that while sin should always horrify us, it should never surprise us—even when it’s Christian leaders falling into it. As Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn famously wrote, “The line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being.” To that end, Carson also reminds congregations of their calling to confront sin and seek restoration through the practice of church discipline. Piper (teacher at Desiring God and chancellor at Bethlehem College and Seminary) speaks about his own experience with this issue and pushes churches to patiently endure God’s hand in purifying his people.
God’s faithfulness to his church never fails or falters, even when those he’s entrusted to lead it do. Watch this video (or listen) to be strengthened in this unwavering truth.

"Pastoral Ministry: What’s the Best Way for a Pastor to Negotiate His Salary?","ca2c5de0-a2cb-5638-e1a8-599540d6e2e0","A pastor talking salary can be awkward stuff. Annual incomes are, after all, the things of earth; unspiritual and unbecoming—far from the meditations of the heavenly minded minister. Or so it seems. Why not just parade his sex life before the elders too!
In the world of wages, pastors inhabit some pretty conflicted space.
On the one hand, a pastor must “manage his household well” (1 Tim. 3:4). This certainly includes managing finances in such a way that bills are paid and the family is clothed, fed, and able to travel in a dependable car made in the 21st century. On the other hand, a pastor must not be “a lover of money” (1 Tim. 3:3). We can expect “enough” (1 Cor. 9:8–11), yet we can’t be greedy for gain (Titus 1:7)—a distinction far easier to espouse than discern. The church should desire an unmuzzled pastor (1 Tim. 5:18), yet the pastor can’t determine what muzzled means.
It’s the “salary strain,” an occupational hazard that seems to come with ministry. If navigated unwisely, it can introduce suspicion and stall the church’s momentum toward the future.
So what’s the best way for a pastor to negotiate his salary? Here are six random thoughts I hope will be helpful.

"Pastoral Ministry: Why Pastors Are Committing Suicide","d0364929-103e-9880-4069-59954129c489","A few years before Craig Sanders lost his father to suicide, a music pastor in their South Carolina town took his life.
“I remember the superficial and judgmental anger I had toward him,” Sanders said. “How could you do that to your daughters? What a selfish act.”
When his own father, Larry, a pastor plagued by depression and insecurity, died, Sanders was also angry at him. But it wasn’t the same; this time, he sought to understand the complexities of mental health and other issues behind his dad's decision to take his life. Sanders felt hurt at being left behind and frustrated with a pastorate that doesn’t make it easy to get help.
“I remember the last conversation with him on the phone. He said, ‘Craig, I’m a failure.’ And I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I said, ‘Dad, you’re my hero. Do you understand that all my life I’ve tried to measure up to you? I’m at seminary because I want to be like you.’”
Larry’s depression, which was in part biological, had likely worsened from diabetes medication, church conflicts, and unhealthy comparison with other ministers, Sanders said. “He really got stuck in the comparison game. . . . He was doing a doctor of ministry degree and reading books on church growth, looking at models of how to make your church grow. He was like, ‘If I’m doing these things and my church isn’t growing, what does that say about me?’”

"Pastoral Ministry: What I Learned from a Pastor’s Letters","afc6003a-4cc4-f361-b8f4-5995420b76e9","Henri Nouwen is a complicated figure. He was a Roman Catholic priest whose influence extended far beyond Roman Catholicism. His ecumenical appeal made more angular Catholics nervous, and his Protestant readers gave “qualified” appreciation. While Nouwen wasn’t a liberal, his life and work is a product of a Vatican II age. It came out after his death that he was gay, though he remained celibate and trusted the church’s teaching. Despite his chaste life, his presence in the gay community and his work with AIDS advocacy in the 1980s often made more religious conservatives nervous.
Nouwen was, admittedly, not a theologian but a pastor, spiritual director, and an activist. For more suspicious readers, he always seemed theologically elusive. For the weak and wounded, he always seemed inviting. A new collection of his letters, Love, Henri: Letters on the Spiritual Life, gives evidence of the latter. Henri, above all, was a pastor with a gift for soul care.
If you’re familiar with Nouwen’s works, you know they tend to be autobiographical. In The Road to Daybreak: A Spiritual Journey and Beyond the Mirror: Reflections on Life and Death, Nouwen wrestles with his struggles and experiences. Other books like The Wounded Healer, The Return of the Prodigal Son, and Reaching Out aren’t necessarily autobiographical, but they reflect his spiritual development. Love, Henri: Letters on the Spiritual Life fills in the gaps of what we know about his life.

"Pastoral Ministry: 3 Warnings from a Pastor Leaving the Ministry","23d69fb3-5d5b-fc19-40ba-59954398a9df","I was in seminary and had never been a pastor before. But I knew God was preparing me to become one, and my desire was to church plant. So I was overjoyed when a pastor asked me to join him in a new church close to where I lived. This was exactly what I wanted to do and seemed like the perfect opportunity.
But I had no way of knowing the most significant lesson I’d learn through that experience would be from the pastor himself. After several years of ministry, the church plant disbanded and the pastor left the ministry. He and I still kept in touch, but the communication dwindled over time. I found out he wasn’t going to church much anymore, and when I challenged him about that, he cut me out of his life.
I was shocked. We’d been so close. We were together on the battlefield, partners in the gospel, slugging it out in that start-up church. What happened? How did this happen? Were there warning signs along the way? As I look back on that experience, I’ve pulled out three lessons for pastors—warnings you could call them—from a pastor leaving the ministry:

Whether it’s the music, the attractive facility, or the feeling of community, we need something to keep the church growing—something besides biblical teaching. How surprising, then, that David Millard Haskell, Kevin N. Flatt, and Stephanie Burgoyne have found that doctrine grows churches. In their peer-reviewed scholarly article for the Review of Religious Research, a prestigious journal, the trio present findings among mainstream Canadian churches showing that—contra the stereotypes—doctrinally conservative churches that reach out aggressively often grow.

This was Eugene Peterson’s response to our inquiry concerning the unique challenge pastors face in relation to power. Our conversation with Eugene was part of a long journey to discover what it meant to embrace power in weakness. He was, of course, correct. Those of us in ministry are all in a position of power. As such, we’ve all embraced a certain form of power. The question is not if we’ve embraced power, but what kind of power we’ve embraced.
This is perhaps the most pressing question in the church today, because it defines everything we do in ministry.

Printers took a gamble on the publication of his Ninety-five Theses (calling for a university disputation on indulgences) since disputations, apart from this one incident, never attained bestseller status.
Once the theses had disseminated his concerns like wildfire in late 1517, Luther recognized what the printers could do to broadcast his message. He began a literary campaign—coordinating with colleagues in Wittenberg and supporters elsewhere—that inalterably changed the church and societies across Europe. 
But Luther’s instruction of students in the interpretation of Scripture and preaching directly reached even more people than did his published writings. With a master of rhetorical theory, Philip Melanchthon, at his side, Luther put the sermon to use in ways as radically different from the past as was his use of printed words.

And thus Mark’s Gospel comes to an end, and an abrupt one at that. Verses 9–20 are not found in the oldest and most reliable manuscripts. Mark’s sudden ending is what he wanted. It makes clear that the disciples were stunned by all of this [e.g. the empty tomb and the angel’s appearance]. They did not expect the resurrection. They did not know how to respond. How would they respond to all this? How will you?
Well, I’ve tipped my hand as to my position on the long ending of Mark’s Gospel. I do not think verses 9–20 were a part of the original text (though I have good friends and respected scholars who do), so I did not preach on them. Still, for those unfamiliar with issues related to textual criticism, this issue can be extremely troubling.

"Pastoral Ministry: Mentoring Future Ministers Is a Community Project","d989aaa0-2d1f-9ddc-159d-5995483cfe40","When I first began mentoring young men who sensed a call to pastoral ministry, my approach was mostly one-on-one discipleship on steroids. I had him read a high stack of books, discussed them with him, and shared how I did my daily devotions, how I sought to love my family, and so on. Before long I realized that, while these were good and necessary things, I was really just transforming him into a “mini-me,” subject to my myriad weaknesses and limitations. He was getting a flat, one-dimensional view of shepherding a local congregation. 
My longtime friend Phil Newton showed me a more excellent way. It transformed the way the church I served approached mentoring and internships. In addition to reading and talking about core doctrines, preaching, and ecclesiology, I began to take young men with me on hospital visits, include them in counseling sessions, and let them preach God’s Word to our congregation. I had them spend time with church members in real-life settings. In short, I began to see mentoring future ministers as a community project.
Thankfully, Phil has made available all he told me and much more in his new book, The Mentoring Church: How Pastors and Congregations Cultivate Leaders (Kregel). These are principles he’s honed and modeled with remarkable effectiveness for more than three decades as pastor of South Woods Baptist Church in Germantown, Tennessee.

Many who started with me didn’t get to the finish line. It’s a grievous percentage. One of the main reasons so many didn’t last, I think, is because no one warned them about the ways ministry can tempt you with pride.
This is where Paul’s words in 2 Corinthians 12:7–10 have been so helpful to me as a pastor.

"Spiritual Leadership: Integrity in Ministry in Latin America (Spanish) Panel Discussion","f055b34a-58a3-18cc-0eb0-59965ff89f11","The Latin culture has not been characterized by accountability either at the personal or the institutional level. The church has not been immune to this weakness. To strengthen the ministry in our region, the people of God need to learn the role of biblical accountability in the formation of character. Apart from this process, supported by biblical principles, accountability becomes intimidation and self-destructive. This panel discusses the current situation of Christian ministry in Latin America related to its personal, doctrinal, and institutional integrity.

"Spiritual Leadership: Leading with Integrity (Spanish)","48ea3c91-5a9e-8cde-4b36-59965f7e9136","Integrity is of the essence in ministry. It is not an accident that the list of requirements to be a pastor in 1 Tim. 3 begins with this: “an overseer must be above reproach.” A man without integrity cannot and will not have the approval of God, and without it, he will lack insight into his truth, grace for the souls of the sheep, and vision for the journey. This workshop addresses what it takes to walk in integrity of heart before God in a humble way.

"Spiritual Leadership: Preparing Leaders of Integrity for Public Influence","c3e9efe4-387b-61fa-6e08-59965f053e33","Moral leadership is vitally needed for communities to thrive and for societies to flourish. Over the last 50 years, changes within our society have made significant demands of those who assume the mantle of public responsibility. In such a context, how should the church prepare young people for lives of faithful leadership? And how should the gospel shape our understanding of the virtues that we need to cultivate among emerging leaders and our understanding of the ends to which their leadership should direct us? In an era when the leadership segment of American society is plagued by scandals and moral decay, there has probably never been a time when people of high integrity can provide greater leadership for wider society. Yet few churches and faith-based institutions are attending to these important opportunities. Join us for this session in which we explore the best ways to prepare Christians for lives of public influence. Based on the country’s largest study of its kind, Lindsay will present findings from his multi-year research project on the lives of national leaders and outline how churches and Christian colleges can work together to develop counter-cultural, Christ-centered leaders who work for the common good.

"Spiritual Leadership: Shepherding with Sense and Sensibility","ed6e4ac9-b2f3-e03e-4f08-599be71a4bf3","Most of us have been trained in seminary to pastor with good sense. As pastors, we’re called to rightly divide the word of truth (2 Tim. 2:15). Sound doctrinal preaching and teaching is a mark of faithful biblical ministry (Titus 2:1). In other words, we labor to present the truth of God with clarity and soundness. But we cannot leave it at that.
While we’re called to pastor with sense, we should also pastor our people with sensibility. The more I spend time with people in the church, the more I agree with James K. A. Smith: people are as deeply moved emotionally as they are intellectually (see Desiring The Kingdom). Therefore, we need to lead the affective or emotional disposition of our people if we want to holistically shape them. I’m not advocating for emotional manipulation, but a more thorough spiritual formation.

I was a young man working in Africa for UNICEF and CARE, two of the world’s largest humanitarian agencies, which gave me a certain perceived power. Native Africans deferred to me simply because I was an American with some responsibility.
This worked its way into me so deeply that I started believing it, which was toxic. When placed in leadership I ruled by the strength of my position—by dictate and fear. In Africa this is called the “Bwana Syndrome,” “bwana” being the “big man.” I became a bwana. My approach was to use others to accomplish my goals. I was building my kingdom.

"Youth Ministry: How to Talk with Students About Sex","ad8b7244-454e-1e56-029a-599bedaa5ca7","We recently survived being personally bombarded by radio, TV, and social media comments regarding the release of the movie 50 Shades of Grey. This story of abusive sexuality has become our culture’s current snapshot of romance. The New York Times reported that it is “the fastest-selling R-rated film in Fandango history.” Covering our eyes and pretending that it is not shaping our youth’s understanding of sexuality is monumentally naive. We must walk alongside our students and children to help them wisely navigate difficult rapids that include both the hyper-sexual messages of culture and the curiosities of their own hearts.
That responsibility may include creating space to intentionally dialogue (in safe and trusted small groups) about the effect of the book/movie, or offering a parents’ seminar on ways to facilitate discussion with their kids on sexuality. Either way, we have to offer more than virginity pledges and purity rings in our youth ministries. We need more than a pretty silver bandaid; we need a story.

"Youth Ministry: Following Christ in Abundance and Affliction","38c21a16-d56a-5a7c-da0a-599bee1e7545","I sat next to a 25-year-old man at the Mockingbird Conference in New York in 2010 as he wailed. He had maneuvered himself into a private corner of the majestic nave of historic Parish of Calvary St. George in Grammery Park. As I stood by listening to his sobs and hoping to comfort him with a quiet presence, a common refrain rang amid his heaves of pain. “I didn’t know life was going to be this hard. I had no idea it would be so painful.”
The young man had left the cultural cocoon of suburbia, church, private school, Christian college, and campus ministry only to find a buzzsaw in the real world. He had naive expectations of happiness, prosperity, and connection as he emerged into adulthood. Instead his hopes had been dragged down a gravel road behind a chariot of loneliness, failure, and disillusionment.
From our brief conversation, I got the impression that he thought obediently following Jesus and complying with Christian morality would insulate him from pain. He had always believed that God had a wonderful plan for his life, but now he just wondered where in the world God could be found.

"Youth Ministry: Rethinking Sex Ed in the Church","a55d9821-1e2f-ddf0-73ed-599bef85c313","I remember going to the Disciple Now retreat at my church in junior high. The focus was sexual abstinence. I respected my youth minister and knew that he loved me, so when he started to lay out the ethics of Christian sexuality, I bought in. He said, “No sex before marriage.” Check, I was going to wait. He said, “No porn.” Check, I was going to try to avoid it. He said, “No staring at the girl with the voluptuous body and no sexual thoughts.” Check, I was going to try my best. The trust and credibility of the youth leader played a large role in my attempt to live within biblical parameters for sexuality.
But then two days after the retreat, it hit me. I am 15 years old. Statistics say that I am not going to get married for at least 10 more years. I am a raging ball of adolescent hormones. The next 10 years are going to be a miserable season of sexual restraint. Furthermore, if I’m lucky, I may succeed for one week in living up to these standards.
I felt miserable. Undoubtedly, many young Christians experience similar feelings of despair when they evaluate the challenging road before them in obedience to God’s standards for sexuality.

"Youth Ministry: How to Survive World Religions 101","75000f76-7f4c-c8ba-fdcc-599bf0b4b5af","Michael Kruger entered his freshman year at the University of North Carolina as a committed Christian. He thought he was ready for the intellectual challenges college would mount against his faith—that is, until he found himself sitting in a New Testament introduction class with Bart Ehrman as his professor. It left him shell-shocked. 
Many students can relate. Churches often have a hard time preparing their youth for a secular university environment. They equip them on a moral level, which is good and important, yet fail to prepare them intellectually and doctrinally. So how can churches better brace young people for the day their faith will be challenged, attacked, and deemed intellectually indefensible by professors and peers?
In this new video, Kruger, president and professor of New Testament and early Christianity at Reformed Theological Seminary in Charlotte, shares some of the lessons he learned in college. He encourages students to check their expectations, prepare for opposition, dig for answers, and more. Above all, he urges them to anchor themselves in the local church.

"Youth Ministry: How Do I Talk to My Kids About Homosexuality?","a1195070-9878-ccd1-7a78-599d362ab2c5","I only have one major point in this article, and it’s this: the best way to talk to your kids about homosexuality is to first talk about healthy sexuality.
In our ministry we’ve recently been preaching an entire book of the Bible in one sermon. I just preached on Judges. Since there are some pretty spicy topics in this book, I sent a PG-13 warning to parents pointing out the rape, murder, and mutilation of the concubine (Judges 19). One mom didn’t read the email. Afterward she confided in me that she hadn’t yet talked to her child about sex, let alone its worldly distortions. Her fears about raising her boys in this world came trembling out as she explained the complicated tight-rope she walks with her lesbian neighbors, their kids, and her own. 
How do I talk to my kids about homosexuality?
As a 27-year-old father of a 3-year-old, it seems both unwise and presumptuous to tell godly, mature parents how to talk to their kids about this issue. Nevertheless, if I’m not talking about it, everyone else is. I have an obligation to give some kind of Christian response to secular wisdom, even if it’s tempered by my lack of parental experience. 
Questions like the one above will only increase in frequency in today’s cultural climate. But this shouldn’t discourage us. Such questions provide unique platforms to talk about healthy marriage in general. Throw in the divorce rate in the church, and it becomes clear many of us are failing to teach our young people about marriage in any form.

If pressed to describe it, the image might include impressive academic credentials, a high-paying job, good medical benefits, a solid retirement package, a house in the suburbs, a lovely spouse, and as many grandchildren as possible (but not to the point of financial endangerment). Behind the high-pressure academics, ACT tutors, private coaches, and race to optimize college acceptance lies a target at which many Christian parents are aiming. I once asked a parent what the college arms race was all about.
“So our kids can live in a neighborhood like this,” he replied, pointing to an affluent street of homes with perfectly manicured lawns.

Puzzled by his lack of concern for academic prestige, I replied that of course it was important to me I attend the best school I could get into.
It wasn’t until I later reflected on that conversation that I recognized my snobbery regarding education. I’d attended an unranked public high school with a low percentage of college-bound students, then received my undergad degree at a highly ranked liberal arts university.

Many church members think serving teenagers is a lot like serving babies: there are those who have the “gift” of youth ministry, and those who simply don’t.
And let’s be honest—teenagers can be messy. I’m a teenager, and I admit that. We aren’t always the easiest to serve. Even those of us following Jesus are still young, inexperienced, and have much to learn. We’re in a different stage of life than any other church member, so it can be difficult to relate to our persistent challenges, struggles, and questions.
But whether you know it or not, the teenagers in your church need you. They need the whole church—pastor, stay-at-home mom, single, married, retired—to love and welcome them as fellow members of the family.
Over my 18 years in the church, I’ve seen three ways every church member can (and should) serve their teenagers: by getting to know us, by not underestimating us, and by teaching us.

Your coach brings you into her office and says, “I’m sorry, Jenny, but you will have to sit out the first game for missing a morning of summer practice.” The coach knows and ignores the fact that the player missed practice because she was traveling to Latin America to work with impoverished and disabled children.
The coach doesn’t say this, but her actions effectively suggest, “I am penalizing you for choosing to serve impoverished and disabled children over attending every practice.”
Imagining such a scenario probably isn’t difficult if you’re the parent of a teenager who participates in sports, theater, or music. Countless Christian families face stressful dilemmas regarding how to prioritize their children’s time outside of school.
Scenarios and questions related to church and family are always complicated. Is it wrong to play on Sunday? Are we offering a poor Christian witness if we miss games and practices for religious events? Is the grandparent’s anniversary party more important than the playoff soccer game? Should we just accept consequences for missing games?

I asked myself this question and started rifling through the names—John Calvin, Herman Bavinck, C. S. Lewis, Soren Kierkegaard. But then I came up with a surprising answer: my mother, Arliett. The reality is that for all the Calvin or Bavinck I may quote, the deepest roots of my theological instincts can be traced to my mom’s instruction in the faith.
Now, my mom doesn’t have “formal theological training.” She was raised in a Catholic school and got saved in a Calvary Chapel Bible study a few years before I was born. I don’t recall us owning a single systematic theology text in the home before I bought mine in seminary. Mom learned theology by attending church and Bible studies, and through her own devotional reading and the countless hours she spent listening to sermon tapes. In time, she learned enough to be recognized by the leadership at our old church and was asked to be a women’s Bible study leader, which she excelled at leading.
After knowing and loving Jesus herself, more than anything Mom wanted my sister and me to know him too. For the first few years of my churchgoing life she was my Sunday school teacher who used flannelgraphs to teach us God’s Word. After her major surgery when I was in junior high, she told us her prayer was that God would let her live so she could encourage us in our faith until we were adults.
Years later, I can say God granted that request. Mom did not let up, ever. She was our full-time spiritual cheerleader and gadfly.
So what exactly did she teach me about theology? Plenty, but four truths stand out.

In my years in youth ministry, though, I’ve seen unhelpful and even harmful methods of trying to make Scripture relevant. Book publishers make Bibles look like magazines, youth workers preach a hipster Jesus, and parents confuse their child’s involvement in a fun youth group for a growing relationship with God.
Yet in our efforts to make Scripture more entertaining, we actually confirm suspicions that it is in fact boring and irrelevant. And when youth workers aren’t as cool as they think they are, their efforts end up looking cheesy, which is the last thing that will help a teenager see the Bible’s importance. 
So how do you break through to a young person so they see Scripture’s significance? How do you impress the Bible’s relevance on a teenager who gauges importance by whatever’s atop her social media stream?

About 13 years in, 30 to 50 students from nearby Iowa State University met regularly as the Baptist Student Union. Ten years later, close to 200 students attended regularly, and Grand Avenue Baptist Church realized its campus ministry had grown so large “it became the tail wagging the dog” and threatened to overwhelm the congregation.
In response, the congregation planted a new church to run its campus ministry, and both took off. Today, more than 22 years later, the Salt Company reaches around 1,400 students every week at Iowa State University, while Cornerstone Church sees about 2,400 people on Sundays.
The twin ministries—to community and campus—have since reproduced themselves at the University of Iowa and the University of Northern Iowa; they’ve grown, too, seeing about 450 students a week. This fall Salt spread to the University of Missouri and Drake University, where roughly 100 students gather each week. The University of Minnesota and the University of Wisconsin are slated for 2017.
""The campus ministry’s strongest asset—and their distinctive feature—is their close tie to the local church.""

"Youth Ministry: 3 Reasons Your Youth Leader Needs Seminary Training","f3c65b74-8927-0f3f-44df-599d3feb8e8d","If I could offer one piece of advice to churches about hiring and supporting youth pastors, it would likely be this: “Once you sense that the youth pastor is going to work out, enroll him in a distance seminary program as soon as possible.”
The money and time my church has invested in my education through Reformed Theological Seminary’s distance program may be the single best contribution they’ve made to my ministry. And through plenty of conversations with others, I’ve found that churches who enroll and support their youth pastors in these programs win big.
Here are three reasons why I’m convinced seminary distance learning is a promising resource for both churches and youth pastors.

"Youth Ministry: 3 Ways a Senior Pastor Can Champion Youth Ministry","331de12c-a9db-1fbb-a0d1-599e22273295","Stories from the trenches frequently involve youth ministers feeling unsupported or unseen in their work. Youth ministry can easily be disconnected from the rest of church life, leaving youth workers on the verge of burnout.
The apostle Paul stands against this sort of marginalization when he writes that the church is a body, with each believing member contributing uniquely as part of the whole (1 Cor. 12:12–14).
Paul goes on to explain that in the economy of the kingdom of God—as in our physical bodies—we can’t do without the parts that appear weaker. The true church can’t look at any of its members and say, “I don’t need you” (1 Cor. 12:21–26). Paul’s counsel regarding unity in the body compels churches to include all sorts of people and groups, including young people. Sadly, many youth ministers don’t experience this kind of cooperation and regard, for their students or themselves.
When I talk with other youth workers about this problem, I’m overcome with thankfulness for the church I serve. Both our senior pastor and also our associate pastor advocate for students, as well as for me. 
Here are three things our senior pastor in particular does to champion our church’s ministry to students:

"Youth Ministry: Teach the Real ‘Personal Relationship with Jesus’","a71f0c85-fecd-103f-746e-599e2328cd75","One of the greatest benefits I received from my youth pastor and Young Life leaders in high school was the critical observation that Christianity is a relationship, not a religion. Having grown up in the 1980s and 1990s American South, where church attendance was often a compulsory cultural behavior, this delineation needed to be clear.
The terminology of a “personal relationship with Jesus” remains an important part of communicating the core of Christianity to teenagers. Many initially misunderstand the Christian faith either as “just another religion” or as a set of moral behaviors. Consistently articulating the relational aspect of following Jesus reinforces the true nature of Christianity and the core of the gospel.
In recent years, however, I’ve questioned the wisdom of the “personal relationship with Jesus” phrase to describe Christianity’s core—for two reasons. 
First, kids have numerous personal relationships, many of which are not particularly healthy. Adolescents may have a contentious or broken relationship with their parents or siblings. Betrayal, competitiveness, and comparison might mark their relationships with peers. Perhaps relationships with teachers and coaches involve pressure, criticism, and performance. By virtue of the tumultuous nature of adolescent social lives, many kids have mixed or conflicted associations when they hear about personal relationships.
Second, given the rise of technology and social media, postmodern kids may have an underdeveloped paradigm for personal relationships. The majority of their communication occurs in electronic form via texting, SnapChat, and GroupMe. When they hear “personal relationship,” then, what they perceive is actually rather impersonal. What they hear may not match our intent.

"Youth Ministry: 4 Reasons to Teach Church History to Teens","f31f2831-c68e-0f21-c279-599e23ae78cb","For many who minister to teenagers, teaching church history is not a high priority. At first glance, such neglect seems valid.
More than 90 percent of children 8 and older have encountered internet pornography. Shows like 13 Reasons Why dominate the entertainment landscape, and increasing numbers of young adults abandon the church after high school. It seems many topics and doctrines are far more urgent.
But it’s possible a false dichotomy exists between “studying church history” and “training up a child in the way he should go” (Prov. 22:6). Far from being a stagnant collection of dates, movements, and odd-sounding names, the church’s past represents a treasure trove of God-exalting wisdom that helps us navigate the cultural realities of the present.

"Small Group: 3 Reasons Your Small Group Is Not the Church","f014f7fd-fcc7-a28f-7ae7-599e2a408d37","Small group ministry is vital for many churches. Groups of around ten believers can be among the best contexts for discussing Scripture, sharing needs, and finding support and praying for one another. In a larger church, there may not be the same opportunity to interact at this level during the main Sunday gathering. We are in a swirl of people, conversations are snatched and bitty, and we are conscious of the need to welcome visitors.
It can be hard to get down to more personal and meaningful contact. Much vital “one another” ministry, then, takes place in small groups. Being with the same gang week in and week out means relationships are established and deepened more quickly. We have the space and context for insights to be shared, and for life’s problems and difficulties to be addressed in an unhurried manner.
It can be easy for a small group to become the main focus of its members’ spiritual lives. In effect, the group can become the church.
This is perhaps understandable, but not desirable. Small group meetings shouldn’t function as a replacement for the Sunday gathering. If your small group becomes your church, you are missing out on much.
Of course, in contexts where there are few believers, churches are small groups and function much as small groups might. Scripture doesn’t prescribe an ideal church size. Healthy churches can be—and are in many places—small in size.
But small groups should not function as a substitute for the church, for three reasons.

"Small Group: 3 Ways to Make the Most of Group Prayer","36c02d14-bd74-c97f-d98e-599e2ac9be29","Last week, I attended our church small group in a member’s living room. As everyone arrived, we arranged ourselves in a circle: on chairs, couches, benches, and even on the floor. After a few minutes, the leader began the meeting by asking, “Okay, what items do we have for prayer?” People uncapped their pens and jotted notes on the back of the week’s study sheet as various members gave requests. Then we prayed about them together.
I’m sure this is a familiar scenario to many of us. We typically begin our prayer times by identifying what we are going to pray about. This is good. Prayer is an activity with content—the Westminster Shorter Catechism calls it “an offering up of our desires unto God”—and we must recognize something we desire before we can ask for it.
Especially in a group, where our goal is unified prayer from every heart, advance direction is particularly helpful. Here we will look at three approaches: choosing a single topic, praying systematically through items on a list, or taking requests from every person. These formats aren’t mutually exclusive—I’ve been in many prayer meetings that allot time to all three—but each has value as we cast our burdens on the Lord together.

"Small Group: 8 Ways to Miss the Point of Small Group","df02d8fa-6779-12b9-57dc-599e2a347384","Thursday night. Bibles open. Six men from the local church pray together. One reads Psalm 31 and applies it to his brother. A strong sense of God-dependence fills the room. 
Sunday after lunch. The church is quiet after a busy morning. Kids play in the next room, while five couples gather to discuss the sermon. They hunger and thirst together for God’s truth.
Small group. Home group. Life group. Missional community. Whatever you call the gathering of an intimate number of believers outside of corporate worship, the goal is the same: fellowship and encouragement around God’s Word.
Yet we can easily miss the mark. Despite our best intentions, we often get sidetracked and forget the reason we’ve gathered. Sometimes we’d rather pursue what’s easier and more comfortable, but this approach lacks transforming power to draw us nearer to God and each other.
Small group has a goal, and we’d do well not to miss it. Here are eight ways we often miss the point of small groups.

It still exists today, with a pastor and members who interact with one another online. But is it really a church? Many churches in America are made up of multiple campuses, but from a biblical point of view, is it possible for one church to be located in numerous places?
These questions are more than theological teasers; they have real significance for God’s people. Darren Carlson, president of Training Leaders International, recently observed, “The greatest problem in missions right now is disagreement over what constitutes a local church.” That’s not a small statement. Clearly we need to think with care about what a church is.

"Church Issues: 8 Lies Christians Believe About Success","1056a0bd-e3ec-e856-120d-599f7ccea5c8","I have spent my whole life trying to be successful. I thought it was what we were supposed to do. Worse than that, I thought success was the mark of a blessed Christian.
If God loves you he’ll bless you, says the prayer of Jabez and North America’s favorite verse, Jeremiah 29:11. His desire is to prosper us, not to harm us—to give us hope and a future.
Just look at all those megachurches, with their million-dollar sanctuaries. Look at all those bestselling Jesus-loving authors and speakers.
But then there are the 21 Egyptians, or the 30 Ethiopians, martyred recently for their Christian faith. There are the faithful pastors who don’t have megachurches, who suffer heartache and setbacks. And there is my own journey as a Christian author, through anorexia, miscarriage, and anxiety. And there are countless other believers who do the right thing, who say the right prayers, who believe, and yet who know the anguish of Job.
At some point in my life, Christianity had become a magic wand instead of a humble posture.
Here are some lies we in the church often believe about success.

"Church Issues: Whatever Happened to Community?","9ad090ce-a76e-039d-eab6-599f7cddbd01","These are strange times. The world has convinced us that we can do fine on our own. In fact, it preaches independence as a virtue. As believers in Christ, we acknowledge our dependency to some degree because we recognize we are hopelessly lost in our sin and must depend on Jesus to save us. But we frequently fail to recognize how much we need other Christians as well.
Scripture never makes that mistake. In fact, many notable passages clearly inform us of our need for others. Take, for example, the Great Commandment (Matt. 22:36-40). Jesus said that the greatest commandment of all is that we are to love God, but the second greatest is like the first in that we are to love others.
Think that through. Closely following your need for God is your need for other believers. Not understanding this profound connection between the vertical and the horizontal weakens the fabric of our faith.

"Church Issues: 10 Steps for Interracial Relationships that Advance the Gospel","5ae3e213-c6e8-b8b0-6378-599f7f7a691f","A few years ago I went to The Gospel Coalition colloquium with a broken heart. I had spent nearly a decade pursuing racial reconciliation in Augusta, Georgia, and seeing what I thought was real progress, only to see the whole city seem to retreat to its historic entrenchments. After asking several friends on the Council for advice, Ed Copeland volunteered to come to Augusta and help me. It’s a longer story for another time, but the Lord is getting glory through our feeble efforts of putting ourselves in the way to be used by the Spirit.
Another surprising grace, however, was how quickly and deeply our friendship developed as a result of putting our shoulders together for a common task for the kingdom. Our friendship also happens to be interracial. Through this David and Jonathan experience I have learned some things about interracial relationships and how the Lord can leverage them to advance the gospel.

"Church Issues: The Danger of Seeking Your Dream Church","24cee4a6-9b47-101e-4134-599f807d27bf","Our church, like every other church, gets phone calls throughout the week from people wanting to know about our assembly. They ask questions, but typically they are not the kinds of questions I would ask if I were looking for a church. “What kind of music do you have? Do you have programs for the kids? Does your church home school? Do you have recovery groups? What Bible translation do you use? Do you serve Krispy Kreme or Dunkin Donuts?” Okay, we’ve never had anyone ask that last one, but at times the questions haven’t been much more substantial.
Then, of course, people come and go. People get upset and leave. Unfortunately, people often leave for reasons that likewise lack substance. They are willing to isolate themselves and fragment the church because their theological or ideological boxes have not all been checked.
For some people, these insubstantial issues manifest themselves in obvious and external behavior. But for many, these issues are quieter and less noticeable. They fester in the heart where no one can see.

"Church Issues: 8 Signs You Are a Discipleship Bully","f3d9f443-eff9-1d71-2c51-599f800e001b","No one likes a bully. Most of us recoil when we encounter a person who preys on the weak and uses verbal and physical abuse to display his superiority. But bullies aren’t only found on grade school or high school playgrounds; they can be found in churches as well, particularly in discipleship relationships.
This kind of bullying, however, does not need to express itself in verbal or physical abuse. It can manifest itself in a subtle form of spiritual tyranny where the teacher, by virtue of his position and self-perceived knowledge, tends to overwhelm and micro-manage his disciple. Sadly, when these kinds of discipleship scenarios progress unchecked, both parties—the discipler and the one being discipled—will find their spiritual life stunted and their relationship with one another in serious jeopardy.
What about you? Are you a discipleship bully? Am I? How can we know if we have become or are on the path to becoming a discipleship bully? I will suggest eight signs.

"Church Issues: Chipotle Church and the Problem of Choice","1b14b7d1-439b-1e48-8b77-599f812b9063","We live in a Chipotle world. Especially in America, the air we breathe is consumerism; the guiding principle is the consumer knows best. We celebrate our right to design a burrito exactly as we prefer it, thank you very much. Our media environment is iEverything—emphasis on the “i.” The pleasure of personalization is a higher value than the inevitable indigestion caused by our ill-conceived culinary combinations. 
This approach has strongly influenced the way we conceive of church. Just as we pick and choose from our preferred proteins, beans, and vegetables in the Chipotle line, we think about church as a thing we can design according to our various tastes and hankerings. If a church stops catering to our particular appetites or begins causing us stomach aches (pastor says something disagreeable, worship music becomes nauseatingly emotionalist, someone speaks in tongues), we simply move on. There are dozens of other places to get a burrito in town; surely one of them will meet all (or most) of our checkboxes of likes, dislikes, and allergies.
And our lists are long. My generation especially has a knack for endless opining about what we want the church to be, or more likely want we don’t want it to be. It’s too trendy or not trend-savvy enough. Too cerebral or not intellectual enough. Too masculine or too feminine. Too homogenous or trying too hard to be diverse. We bristle at the music, the preaching, the politics, the pastor. We lament the church’s apathy about the arts or anemic theology of singleness. We complain about the Costco coffee, the way communion isn’t done communally, the awkward “college and career” class, and so on. There’s always something.

"Church Issues: What About the Minority Experience in America Do Whites Often Miss?","55977de7-b053-fcfa-fb42-599f81ba6f3e","One of the beautiful byproducts of the gospel is that it gathers believers from many backgrounds into one body. Still, we don’t share all the same experiences. Those in the American cultural majority simply don’t face everything minority brothers and sisters do, and vice versa.
What are some of these experiences? What burdens do cultural minorities bear that many of us in the majority are prone to overlook and not handle with care? Is there any benefit to gathering in an ethic-centered context?
In a new roundtable video, Trip Lee (hip-hop artist and pastor of Cornerstone Church in Atlanta), Alex Medina (creative director at Reach Records), and Jemar Tisby (co-founder of Reformed African American Network) help us to grasp some issues minorities in our churches face and to consider ways “cultural-majority believers” can be more considerate of the minority experience.

"Church Issues: 5 Ways to Be a ‘Third-Culture’ Christian","1dc570b0-25ac-1c46-6757-599f817b905b","Missions is cross-cultural, cross-geographic ministry. Such a statement implies distance, a space individuals and families must traverse. Understanding this explains why we no longer refer to children of cross-cultural workers simply as “missionary kids.” Instead, the missionary community has largely adopted the terminology of “third-culture kid,” or TCK.
This new vocabulary has a good goal. It’s meant to be descriptive, even instructive, of the reality such children experience living in three cultures simultaneously. They’re expatriates living abroad in a host culture. Yet the culture they inhabit is neither fully American (or whatever their nationality) nor fully that of their host country. Instead, their world of experience is some mixture of the two cultures, creating a distinctly third realm of experience.

"Church Issues: Church Should Feel Uncomfortable","f19a6ea6-ca48-6b37-2c7e-599f844cb5cd","I grew up attending Baptist churches in the Midwest—the kind where men’s quartets sing gospel songs as “special music” but no one dares raise their hands during a worship song. For most of my 20s I attended a Presbyterian church where things like Maundy Thursday and Advent candles were a big deal. These days I consider myself Reformed and read books about Thomas Cranmer for fun. My ideal church service would involve the Book of Common Prayer, an organ, the eucharist, and a sermon out of a Pauline epistle that referenced everyone from Augustine and Spurgeon to Marilynne Robinson and N. T. Wright. In my dream church, the “peace” would be exchanged every Sunday, ashes imposed every Ash Wednesday, and G. K. Chesterton discussed in the high school youth group.
The picture I’ve just painted of my “dream church” looks nothing like the church where I’m now a member. The local church where I now serve is non-denominational, meets in a renovated warehouse, and has no liturgical bent. The music is loud and contemporary. It’s Reformed-ish but Holy Spirit-focused, with impromptu “words” from the congregation and quiet prayer in tongues a not-uncommon occasion. To be honest, the worship services often make me a bit uncomfortable.
And I’m perfectly happy with that. I love my church.

"How to do a word study in the original language","b43a5361-7b92-1bdc-3b3e-59ae3f8e9e1e","The Bible was not written in English, so it is not a good idea to do word studies based on
an English dictionary. There are nuances present in English that are not part of the Greek,
Hebrew or Aramaic, and nuances in the original languages that are not found in the English. As this is a University course, wikipedia is forbidden [it is not a legitimate encyclopedia or resource of any kind]. I do not want you using any English dictionaries either. Use of English dictionaries will result in loss of points.","GProConneXt Users",3000,"Think Biblically","English"

by Michelle Spomer","GProConneXt Users",3001,"Think Biblically","English"
"How to Do a Word Study","32019d50-9ebb-f81e-caa6-59ae401023a9","Word studies are a good way to gain a deeper understanding of Scripture. By looking at
a particular word in its original context(s) and language, one can see the various
nuances and meaning that aren’t necessarily apparent in a given English translation. In
the Stamps Theological Library, there are specific tools to use for word studies.
Many of the dictionaries and wordbooks that are used for word studies are arranged
alphabetically by either Hebrew or Greek, which obviously is only useful to those who
have studied those languages. However, there are resources that are arranged
alphabetically by English words (or contain English glossaries), and/or by a numbering
system. There are two major numbering systems currently in use: 1) Strong’s numbers,
and 2) G/K numbers (“G/K” stands for the two creators of this system, E.W. Goodrick /
J.R. Kohlenberger). When used in coordination with concordances, in-depth word
studies are possible for those who don’t know the Biblical languages.

"Calling: No, you probably aren’t called to be a pastor","a4c62524-7cf6-64d0-449c-59b5ea21e570","It seems like every new believer—particularly the younger men—have a moment in those first couple of years of their faith where they ask, “Am I called to be a pastor?” I had that question rattling around in my head for several years. It was one that Emily and I spent a great deal of time alternately avoiding and praying about. And avoiding again. And praying about again. And so on.
Certainly I have some gifts that lend themselves to such a role. I can teach and preach. I’m not a schmuck, nor is my reputation characterized by a bad case of being a knucklehead. I’m consistently trying to work on my character, by God’s grace… but that doesn’t mean I’m supposed to be a pastor.1 And that’s okay.
You probably aren’t called to be one, either. And that’s okay, too.
But you know who is?2 Your pastor, and mine. And that’s a good thing because when I see mine in their roles, it just makes sense.

We are all ministers (1 Peter 2:9). But not all of us are called into vocational ministry. Wherever you are on the “call to ministry” spectrum, here are five questions you need to answer.

Though all Christians are called to serve the cause of Christ, God calls certain persons to serve the Church as pastors and other ministers. Writing to young Timothy, the Apostle Paul confirmed that if a man aspires to be a pastor, “it is a fine work he aspires to do” (1 Tim 3:1, NASB). Likewise, it is a high honor to be called of God into the ministry of the Church. How do you know if God is calling you?

"Calling: How Can I Tell If I’m Called to Pastoral Ministry?","ebb4e781-8ddf-0611-5e4c-59b5edb9979e","I’ve been asked the question many times, and I’m not sure I agree with it. The question often assumes that pastors, unique among all the vocations of the world, will (and sometimes must) have a powerful, divine, subjective call to ministry that overwhelmingly points them in their God-ordained direction. I don’t see support for that sort of normative experience in Scripture.
But I understand what young men are looking for. They understand that pastoral ministry is weighty work, not to be entered into lightly. So naturally they want to know that their inclinations are not self-serving and their direction is not a fool’s errand. They are looking for a few signposts along the way to show them that they’re not obviously on the wrong road. That’s a commendable impulse.
Here are several questions you should ask yourself as you ponder a call to pastoral ministry.

"Calling: Are You Called to Be a Pastor?","81fc6c10-45c2-dd07-90da-59b5ee018648","I’ve often thought of doing a joint interview by email, where two people receive the same questions and provide independent answers, then the results are published together.

"Calling: How can I decide whether or not I should be a pastor?","966e7870-8957-3e3c-a464-59b5eeeb323a","Traditionally, Christians have referred to two kinds of “call” a man must experience before entering the pastorate: an internal call and an external call. While the word “call” is potentially misleading, the basic idea is right. Before becoming a pastor, a person should both desire to do the work and receive confirmation from a church. Part of doing both involves considering the biblical qualifications of an elder.","Public",3152,"Lead Biblically","English"
"Character: Eleven Reasons Pastors Are Trusted Less Today","6ef5ef3e-662f-06d4-af0b-59b5f0ac87db","A day does not pass that I do not hear from a hurting pastor. Serving in that role has to be one of the most challenging vocations today. Sure, there are some bad and immoral pastors. But the vast majority of our pastors serve their congregations in a way that honors God and makes a difference in the community.
But both anecdotally and by objective research, we learn that pastors are trusted less and held in lower esteem each year. A recent Pew Research poll found that the favorable view of clergy had declined to 37 percent of those surveyed.
Why are pastors no longer held in high esteem? What is behind the precipitous drop in favorable ratings almost every year? Allow me to offer eleven possible reasons. As you will see, they are not mutually exclusive.

"Character: Pride in the Pulpit","2fd47c5b-aa96-5e85-0461-59b5f43af2b6","When I hear an essentially law-driven sermon, asking the law to do what only the grace of Jesus Christ can accomplish, I am immediately concerned about the preacher. I wonder about his view of himself, because if you have any self-consciousness about your own weakness and sin, you find little hope and comfort for yourself and your hearers in that kind of sermon.
You see this dynamic in the Pharisees. Because they thought of themselves as righteous, perfect law-keepers, they had no problem laying unbearable burdens on others. Their misuse of the law had its roots not only in bad theology, but also in ugly human pride. They saw the law as keepable, because they thought they were keeping it. And they thought others should keep it as well as they did. They were the religious leaders of their day, but they were arrogant, insensitive, and judgmental. They were not part of what God was doing at the moment—-no, they were in the way of it.

I wish I could say that my pastoral experience is unique, but I have come to learn in travels to hundreds of churches around the world that sadly, it is not. Sure, the details are unique, but I see in many pastors the same disconnect between the public persona and the private man. I have heard so many stories containing so many confessions that I grieve over the state of pastoral culture in our generation. The burn of this concern, coupled with my knowledge and experience of transforming grace, drives me to write this column.
Three underlying themes operated in my life, and I have observed the same themes in the lives of many pastors with whom I have talked. I will examine these in this column and the one to follow next week. Unpacking these themes helps us examine where pastoral culture may be less than biblical and consider temptations either resident to or intensified by pastoral ministry.

"Danger: Seven Deadly Thoughts of Leaders","e520c936-a43a-71ea-775c-59b6040ad1b7","By the time we hear of a leadership failure, any attempts at intervention to save the leader are usually futile. The damage has been done. The family or organization suffers as their leader has fallen or, at the very least, made a major mistake.
Most great leadership failures, however, don’t begin with some stupid action. The leader usually has thoughts about the action well before he or she actually makes them. Some of those thoughts can be warning signs to heed. They are like the bright, flashing red light that demands we stop. Failure to stop can result in great harm.
I’ve had the opportunity through the years to listen to leaders talk about their biggest victories and their greatest failures. When the latter takes place, these leaders reflect that, most of the time, the failure took place in a deadly thought pattern. They lament they didn’t recognize these deadly thoughts for the warnings that they were. Here are the seven most significant warning thoughts I’ve heard:

"Disappointments: Avoiding Disappointment Distraction","9a975ada-eb25-36e5-1ce2-59b608e7df61","At our church we designate June as a special month of Wednesday night events, most of them of the picnic/swim party/outreach activity variety—what we call a “Level 1” event. We use these both as outreach, encouraging our members to invite and bring unchurched friends, and also as opportunities for our regular attenders to get to know one another, which is always a challenge in a church with multiple services.
This year we planned for one Wednesday night event to be a completely different kind of experience: a service of praise and prayer, with alternating musical worship and times of testimony and intercession. So last week we enjoyed a brief time of fellowship outside by the South Elkhorn Creek, eating ice cream sandwiches, and then entered the sanctuary where one of our pastors, our choir, praise band, and soloists led us in one of the greatest times of praise and petition I have ever known.
I cannot in this space convey in any adequate or meaningful way the glory that came down in that room. It seemed the Lord just delighted to say, “You didn’t come here expecting much, but I am going to fill this summer evening with a glimpse of my splendor and beauty, with myself.” Whether in the testimony of a deacon whom God healed from non-Hodgkins lymphoma, the tears of a teenager singing in the choir, or the sharing of burdens and prayer, God was evident, and he was magnificent. I was dazed and overwhelmed with a palpable sense of his presence.

I really resonate with the challenge expressed—especially that it gets harder the longer you’re a Christian since you often increasingly have fewer non-Christian friends (and in my case, all my co-workers are Christians), and it’s easy to slip into a mind set of “well, I’m not good at it, so I won’t do it.”
This is a frequent point of discussion in our home as it’s tempting to think there’s some formula or set program you have to follow. But the most helpful thing to remember about evangelism is that a lot of it happens in the day-to-day through intentional relationships in your neighborhood. My wife is great at this (though she doesn’t necessarily believe me). She’s building friendships with other parents, being open about her faith, and sharing the gospel (either in part or in whole) whenever an opportunity presents itself.
The best part is, none of it’s forced. There’s no plotting or contriving of scenarios. Which is probably the best way for it to happen, isn’t it?

What if we just asked our pastor’s wife to candidly, honestly, even anonymously share some of their secrets? What if we invited them to share their hearts and tell us what they wished the church knew?
I posed a simple, open ended question to a panel of pastors’ wives in different states, from different denominations, with various years of service, “If you could tell the church a few things about your role as a pastor’s wife, what would you say?”
The women selected are the wives of music ministers, children’s leaders, senior pastors and youth pastors. Some of them serve in churches with large staff and even larger budgets, others in newer church plants, and even some from old and barely surviving congregations. Despite such different backgrounds, their responses were strangely similar and in several cases, almost identical.

She is expected to be a model wife, nurturing mother, friend to everyone, run a women's ministry, throw every baby shower, and cook every meal. These expectations are often unfair, unhelpful, and most importantly, unbiblical. ""Pastor's Wife"" is not a secret third office of church leadership. The Bible contains no job description for the pastor's wife, which is why extra-biblical expectations are often placed upon her.

"Family: Battling Discouragement as a Pastor’s Wife","4124bdd9-64bf-624b-8e9c-59b63722715c","Several years ago, I experienced what appeared to be a fairly sudden onset of significant discouragement. It both surprised and scared me that, despite my best attempts, I couldn't shake it on my own. And it wasn't going away. A series of difficult circumstances and relationships left me feeling lost and hopeless in the church we'd worked so hard to plant. I was stuck, unable to find a way out. It was painful to admit I was quickly turning into the person I'd tried so hard not to become—a discouraged and disillusioned pastor's wife.
What followed was a humbling yet powerful season of asking God to unravel the mess in my heart.
One of the first things he showed me was my deep fear of admitting how much I was struggling with discouragement. The battle seemed like a tremendous failure I should have been able to avoid. In retrospect, I had so feared the implications of discouragement that I refused to acknowledge its tiny seeds when they first appeared years earlier. My default reaction to encountering a difficult emotion was to ignore it and keep moving. I viewed this response as perseverance and self-control, but, in reality, I was hiding and living in denial. Fear, anger, disappointment, and sadness were piling up, but I assumed acknowledging them meant I was in danger of becoming a person who wallowed around in destructive self-pity. In reality, ignoring these emotions in an attempt to prove my own maturity and strength was a primary cause of my discouragement.
Over time, I learned emotions weren't the enemy, but rather a helpful tool. Additionally, I saw that processing those emotions through the truth of Scripture alongside wise and godly people led to less self-absorption, not more.

"Family: How Much Should a Pastor Tell His Wife?","8717027c-e779-c83f-d014-59b6384692de","Pastors know privileged information not simply because of their positions but because of their influence. Trust has been established. Help has been previously offered and accepted. The sheep find in the shepherd a safe place to share deep, personal information. But this relationship becomes complicated when pastors receive personal information in confidence but need to seek additional help to know how to extend wise care and counsel.
The pastor's wife further complicates confidentiality. After all, she is the pastor's helpmate and support. She cares for him on a daily basis. When he comes home for dinner, she sees the burdens weighing on him. She bears the brunt of his distracted mind. She deals with his clipped responses. And she naturally wants to know, “What is wrong?”
So how much does a pastor share with his wife? Should a pastor keep some things from his wife? Let me turn for a balanced perspective to my wife—-a pastor's wife.

"Family: Flourish: An Online Community for Ministry Wives","2f99e516-329b-ec10-5318-59b63a93b4b5","The blogosphere is a neat place. You can get connected to people through Internet channels in ways you probably wouldn’t in traditional, physical spaces. In the past year or so, I’ve enjoyed getting to know Kathy Ferguson Litton.
Kathy gave us some helpful advice as we were in the developmental stages of The Gospel Project. She’s passionate about discipleship. You may recognize her husband, Ed, pastor of First Baptist North Mobile. He was in the movie Courageous as the pastor who preaches a funeral and counsels a grieving family).
Kathy serves at the North American Mission Board as the National Director of Ministry to Pastors’ Wives. She has established a new website called “Flourish” for ministry wives. Or follow her ministry on Twitter and Facebook. I’ve asked Kathy to tell us more about the online community she is developing.

"Family: The Pastor’s Wife and Her Primary Ministry","1e6c7f34-0ef4-96c2-31bc-59b63a040dcc","An article in our local newspaper announced an airline's new policy—“your fourth wife flies free”—in honor of a ruler who had just taken his fourth wife.
When my husband traveled to India for ministry he brought back an interesting anecdote. He said, “Every pastor I met introduced himself to me like this: 'My name is So-and-so; I have one wife and however-many kids.'” One of our church members from India explained that the rules of English grammar might be the reason the Indian pastors said that they have “one” wife instead of “a” wife.
Even so, in this area of the world, monogamous marriages are not assumed. I suppose it couldn't hurt for married pastors to affirm that they are married to only one wife!
Besides the “only one wife if you're married” clause, 1 Timothy 3 and Titus 1 list nearly 20 requirements for a potential under-shepherd of the Lord's sheep.
But where is the list of qualifications to be an elder's wife? Scripture-based ecclesiology offers no explicit job description for the office of pastor's wife, because there is no such office.

"Family: The Pastor’s Wife Is a Pastor’s Wife","4e525b4b-b1b0-b987-d24b-59b63b8576e2","“There you are,” a woman whispered in my ear as she grabbed my elbow during a church gathering. “I've been looking everywhere for you!”
I braced myself. You never know what a statement like that could mean—especially at a church gathering.
Did I leave my car running in the parking lot? Did one of my kids have an accident involving bodily fluids? Or horror of all horrors—is my husband's zipper down while he's preaching?
The woman led me from the back of the meeting room where I was standing into the lobby area.
Was there someone critically in need of prayer? Is there a baby being born in the lobby? Did someone leave a pumpkin latte out here with my name on it?
The woman urgently pointed to the ceiling. “Look! The air conditioning isn't cold enough. You have to fix it.”
I breathed a sigh of relief and gave her a quick hug. “The air conditioner? I don't know how to fix the air conditioner. I barely know how to read a Celsius thermostat.”
She thought about this for a second and chuckled. “But you are the pastor's wife.”

"The Book of Hebrews: Lesson 1: The Background and Purpose of Hebrews","b0ba5709-16f2-64a4-71e0-59c87602eba0","Hebrews is one of the most challenging books in the New Testament.

But it helps when we recognize that the original audience was facing persecution and that they were tempted to turn away from Christ. That’s why the author of Hebrews placed his emphasis on standing strong in the faith, and it’s why this book is one of the most valuable and encouraging to Christians in every age.

"Construyendo Una Teología Bíblica: Lección 4: Contornos de la Teología Bíblica en el Nuevo Testamento (pdf)","87aab6c2-ce44-78c2-1266-59c9ee3c8ef7","Crisitanos fieles siempre han reconocido la importancia del progreso de la historia bíblica, especialmente cuando se relaciona con la caída de la humanidad en pecado y la obra redentora de Dios. La disciplina de la teología bíblica surgió como un medio para estudiar este progreso de manera responsable. Así como la teología sistemática, la teología bíblica organiza ideas en maneras que incrementa nuestro entendimento de las Escrituras. Pero mientras que la teología sistemática organiza sus ideas de acuerdo a temas, la teología bíblica organiza sus conclusiones en períodos históricos o épocas. Utilizada correctamente, la teología bíblica es una herramienta poderosa y útil para la interpretación y aplicación de la Biblia.

Abrumados por la historia y literatura complicadas ellos suelen ignorar esta parte de la Biblia. Pero Dios no nos dio la profecía para ignorarla. Además, la profecía es sumamente valiosa para nosotros cuando las interpretamos correctamente.

"El Libro de Hebreos: Lección 1: El Trasfondo y Propósito de Hebreos","735cf208-5bba-d17a-27fe-59cb4ecbfc1b","Hebreos es uno de los libros más desafiantes en el Nuevo Testamento. Muchos de sus tópicos y temas son difíciles de entender y tienden a enfocarse de forma diferente a otros libros del Nuevo Testamento. Pero ayuda el reconocer que la audiencia original estaba enfrentando persecuciones y que ellos estaban tentados a alejarse de Cristo. Por eso es que el autor de Hebreos pone su énfasis en permanecer firmes en la fe y esta es la razón por la que este libro es uno de los más valiosos y alentadores para los cristianos en cualquier época.

The creation week, Adam and Eve, the Garden of Eden, Noah's ark, the Tower of Babel — Christians know these stories well. But how many believers know what Moses intended these stories to teach?

In its ancient context, this primeval history was not a simple historical record. Rather, it was a forceful argument condemning Egypt and encouraging Israel to follow Moses to the Promised Land.

"Third Millenium Ministries","e96c4232-7c8f-19cb-f504-59db344d0fad","Church leaders need advanced education in theology, biblical studies, and other Christian disciplines. That's why we're here. Think of us as an enormous online library of seminary instruction and research tools.
Third Millennium Ministries is a publisher, not a school. So, we don't conduct live classes with students or offer degrees. But we have many educational resources for anyone that wants them, including online video courses, audio courses, reading materials, recommended assignments, and online testing. We can help your school expand its course offerings, or even help you start an online school.
Our courses are used in many seminaries, Bible colleges, churches and other ministries around the world. Our website provides these same materials to everyone at no cost.
This website provides video seminary instruction, audio seminary instruction, audio sermons and lectures, seminary lecture manuscripts, books, magazine articles, an extensive Q&A knowledgebase, and special sections dedicated to the study of Paul's letters and to worship.
Our navigation divides resources by media type:

video (under the watch section of our navigation bar; also available on DVD and flash drive through our eStore)
audio (under the listen section of our navigation bar)
text (under the read section of our navigation bar)
We also have a custom search engine that searches by media type, author/speaker/teacher, subject, series, and keyword. There's a Google search option, too, but we recommend using that only if you can't find what you need through our custom search engine.

To take fullest advantage of this website, you'll need a relatively current version of your browser with JavaScript enabled.
