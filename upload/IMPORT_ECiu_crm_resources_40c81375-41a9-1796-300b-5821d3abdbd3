Personal Life and Growth,,"Regular growth is essential to the spiritual vitality of every believer. If you aren’t progressing in your faith, you’re stagnating and becoming less useful for ministry.

Leading With Love,,"Welcome to the six-part series on Leading with Love. Love is indispensible. An elder must lead and teach with love. Since leaders set the tone within the church, it is vital that the members have a loving and Christ-like example to follow. Kevin Fitzgerald presents concepts from I Corinthians 13, the chapter of love, on how a Shepherd Elder must conduct himself in the church. The expectations are high. An elder is to be a people-person, one with high integrity, great faith, be generous, credible, live a sacrificial life, and these qualities are just the beginning. And, he might have it all, but if he doesn’t have love; it would be such a loss. Love must crown it all. Even to give your life for Christ and his children means nothing if not done in love. Without love, our most extraordinary gifts and highest achievements are ultimately fruitless to the church and before God. Kevin helps the us see what love looks like in “shoe leather”, in practical terms. For if Christ gave His life for the Church it is a big deal to Him and it must remain a big deal to the elder.",,,,,,,,,http://biblicaleldership.com/effective-shepherding-172/leading-gods-flock-0/leadership-and-administration/,0,,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,1,,0,akhalil,1,Users,akhalil,1,Users,,Users

Decision Making,,"No training for elders is complete without a discussion about decision making. After all, the decisions of elders have a huge impact on the local church. People’s spiritual lives are at stake, and that is not an understatement. The reality though is that leaders don’t always agree on things. See the conflict between Paul and Barnabas in Acts 16 for an example of that. This series will look at some fundamental principles from the early church on decision making, and then will give you some guidance in developing a decision making policy. In a perfect world where everyone was completely in step with the Holy Spirit, and fully mature in their faith and wisdom, there would be no need to have this series. However, elders are men of God, their sanctification is still a work in progress.So we need to think through how to make decision.

Transitioning Elders,,"An important part of leadership is for elders to consider the continuity of leadership which lasts beyond their lifetime. The concept of transitioning leaders is Biblical. We see many examples of leaders training future leaders, including Paul, Timothy and even Jesus Himself. Jesus did not wait till the end of his earthly ministry before looking for those who would continue the work that he started. He recruited them early in his ministry and trained them specifically.

How do you handle the practical issues of financial support without turning the fulltime elder into a “hired hand” or acquiesce to a “one man” ministry. Join Chuck Gianotti in this four part series, as he examines the role and practical implications of a full-time elder as part of a team of elders in the local church.",,,,,,,,,http://biblicaleldership.com/effective-shepherding-172/elder-relationships-0/transitioning-elders/,0,,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,1,,0,akhalil,1,Users,akhalil,1,Users,,Users
